       "[{\"DOCNO: FT911-2950, TEXT: THE POLITICAL issue dominating the Eden District Council elections this year\\nis whether party politics are, in fact, desirable at all. Bounded by the\\nLake District to the west and the Pennines to the east, the 900 square mile\\nValley of Eden has long been an earthly paradise with sheep as plentiful as\\nideologues are rare.\\nBut are they any more? In the George Hotel amd the conspiratorial coffee\\nhouses of Penrith's Devonshire Street, citizens are agog over the Cumberland\\nand Westmorland Herald's sensational headline: 'Eden Election Takes On a\\nPolitical Outlook.'\\nAt issue is the revelation that of the council 37 seats an unprecedented 17\\nare being contested. Worse still, in Penrith itself - Eden's capital with\\nsome 13,000 of the Valley's 47,000 population - conventional parties have\\nswept in to challenge a long tradition of dogma-free politics.\\nThe outgoing council had just two non-independent councillors. Now all three\\nmain parties have set up their stalls.\\nUntil recently, other issues - the proposed visitors' centre (rejected), the\\nnew pig farm (opposed) and the infamous 'Penrith Pong' emitted by an offal\\nprocessing plant - have hogged local debate.\\nNow, the politicians themselves are the talking point and, typically, they\\nblame each other.\\nMr Stephen Parry, a public relations man, justifies his candidature for the\\nTories on the ground that Mr Peter Hodgson is standing for Labour.\\nMrs Joan Robinson, a Liberal Democrat, says that she has taken to a party\\nplatform as she already leads the Liberal Democrats on Cumbria Council.\\nDespite its Clochemerle-like qualities, the issue is a serious one. While\\nsome claim the party struggle is meaningless at local level, others say it\\naids planning and spurs constructive action.\\nIn consequence, attention has now turned to the avowedly non-political\\nResidents' Association that has long dominated the town.\\nSeveral citizens alleged this week that several of its nine candidates were\\nprominent masons. It was also claimed that council business is often\\ncompleted well away from the chamber.\\nAn Italian P2 in Cumbria? No such allegation was made.\\nNone the less, most critics insisted on anonymity. 'There is a concern about\\nthe possibility that certain councillors are being dictated to by certain\\norganisations,' was as far as one would go.\\nMr James Chambers, respected shopkeeper, mason and 25 years a councillor,\\ndenied as 'ridiculous' any suggestion of a conspiracy, promising to fight,\\nfight and fight again to save the non-party politics he loves.\\nThat said, he conceded that Eden's era of innocence appeared to be coming to\\na close. As he left, his handshake was virtue itself.\\n******\\nThe claims that something is rotten in the Valley of Eden owe not a little\\nto an historic battle between Councillor John Moffat, a bluff Independent,\\nand a council leader.\\nIn 1986, Mr Moffat was ejected by the police after trying to sit in as an\\nobserver on a working party examining council reorganisation.\\nProtesting at what he claimed was repeated and unnecessary secrecy , Mr\\nMoffat fought his rejection all the way to the Court of Appeal. He lost, at\\na cost to his own pocket of Pounds 80,000.\\nThe working party, meanwhile, came to no conclusion.\\n******\\nTen miles away in Appleby, few dare hope that Mr Michael Heseltine's review\\nof local government will free them from under Penrith's jackboot.\\nThe county town of Westmorland, officially killed off in the 1974\\nreorganisation, is now a reluctant part of Eden District though it jealously\\npreserves its 16th century Moot Hall, its mayor and its memories - lodged in\\nthe mind of its 85-year-old historian, Mr Martin Holmes.\\nThe meddlings of Westminster and the annual gipsy horse fair aside, not a\\nlot has happened in Appleby for the past few centuries, though there was a\\nnasty clash last year over plans to build homes on the edge of the cricket\\npitch.\\nAccording to Mr Holmes, the last real political excitement came during the\\nCivil War when Lady Anne Clifford, a royalist benefactress, lived in the\\ntown under the suspicious eyes of the parliamentary garrison led by one\\n'Harrison the Regicide.'\\nLady Anne survived. But Harrison confirmed his lack of good manners by\\nsitting up and boxing the ears of his executioner not before but after being\\ndisembowelled.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2951, TEXT: LABOUR'S spokeswoman on the Square Mile, Ms Marjorie 'Mo' Mowlam, claims:\\n'Up until now there has been a natural antagonism between the City and\\nLabour. That has now passed.\\n'As the European single market develops, Labour is now seen as user-friendly\\n -our aim is to make the City user-friendly to the consumer throughout\\nEurope.'\\nIf Ms Mowlam's upbeat reading of her party's relationship with the City owes\\na little to wishful thinking, the fact that it publicly wishes to be\\nuser-friendly to the manipulators of capital is evidence of how much the\\nparty has changed.\\nFew dispute a sea-change in Labour's approach to its old enemy, nor its\\ndesirability. With the single European market looming, Ms Mowlam and her\\ncolleagues are aware that, in government, they will bear responsibility for\\nchampioning the interests of British financial services.\\nIn consequence, both sides have replaced the old confrontational rhetoric\\nand insult swapping for something approaching a constructive dialogue.\\nNo discussion of Labour's plans for regulating the self-regulators or\\ntackling insider dealing is now complete without Ms Mowlam volunteering\\nunsolicited praise for Sir David Walker at the Securities and Investment\\nBoard or Mr Peter Rawlins of the Stock Exchange. Both institutions are\\ndeemed to be 'moving in the right direction'.\\nElsewhere, Labour now puts heavy emphasis on a two-way street of\\nconsultation before legislation with the accent on the need for flexibility,\\nsimplicity and transparency. This applies to the City's dealings with its\\nclients and, indeed, to a Labour government's approach to the financial\\nservices industry.\\nAbove all, Labour's message is that its intentions to improve consumer\\nprotection and counter City fraud dovetail with everyone's objective of\\nensuring London stays the EC's financial services capital.\\n'We have got to think strategically about what we want in Europe,' Ms Mowlam\\nsays. 'At the moment we are in the lead, but, without strategic thinking, in\\nfive or 10 years time Frankfurt will be snapping at our heels.'\\nOne consequence of such an exercise is to recognise the small 'c'\\nconservatism of European consumers and act accordingly. Labour insists that\\nit supports the goal of wider share ownership.\\nBut on City regulation, takeovers and SIB, it is determined to act.\\nMost vigorously, it argues that the 1986 Financial Services Act must be\\nreformed. The profusion of regulatory bodies - the Stock Exchange, the\\nDepartment of Trade and Industry and the self-regulating organisations\\n(SROs) - confuses Britons and foreigners alike and must be simplified.\\nTurning SIB into an 'executive agency' accountable to the trade and industry\\nsecretary would allow SIB to absorb many of the DTI's investigative powers,\\nMs Mowlam says.\\nThe insider dealing team based at the stock exchange would be relocated at\\nSIB.\\nIn turn, the reformed SIB would also have responsibility for a product\\nmonitoring group to ensure financial products meet their marketing claims.\\nIt would enforce a greater degree of disclosure - of agents' commissions or\\ntie-ins between insurers and banks, for example - at point of sale.\\nTighter investor protection such as legislative powers to oversee company\\nprospectuses and share issues are also under consideration. Labour would\\nagree that the new functions taken over from the DTI should be funded by\\ncentral government.\\nThe heavy costs of fraud investigations and investor compensation for\\nvictims would be born, where feasible, by guilty parties. But already\\nhard-pressed SRO affiliates will continue to cover the financing of existing\\nresponsibilities.\\nThose financial pressures would only hasten Ms Mowlam's other goal of\\nslimming down the present four SROs to two - one for wholesale and one for\\nretail services.\\nIf they did not, SIB could simply 'unrecognise' its errant offspring.\\nThis, together with simplified rules and, possibly, graduated protection\\nrequirements distinguishing between the small investor and institutions\\nwould reduce costs, Labour believes.\\nThe new SIB would appoint a chief executive from outside the civil service\\nand maintain its own salary structure. Government would outline policy,\\ndetermine tasks and establish an advisory board.

'I am\\nnot opposed to takeovers, but I want them to be for the right not the wrong\\nreasons.'\\nNonetheless, she goes on to insist that the Takeover Panel will be given a\\nhigh degree of flexibility. 'I accept the argument that it is not in\\nanybody's interest to create litigation battles,' she adds.\\nWith the threat of European takeovers in mind, Ms Mowlam says Labour will\\nreview the 40 per cent limit on building societies' borrowings from the\\nwholesale markets, which could make them vulnerable to continental\\npredators.\\nTaken together, Labour believes these measures combine a recognition of the\\nrealities of the coming single European market.\\nBy bolstering industry's defences and spring-cleaning the City's less\\nsalubrious corners, it claims it can protect British interests and better\\nchampion them abroad.\\nIn the meantime, Ms Mowlam is caustic about inflexibility in the Tories'\\nhandling of the EC's investment services directive - now under negotiation -\\nand its 'do nothing' response to the local government 'swaps' cases and\\ntheir damaging effect on the attitude towards London of foreign banks.\\nWith Europe the 'headline issue' in the City, the Conservatives approach to\\nBrussels is to attempt to dictate their terms.

He\\nstarted his career at a small commercial photographic laboratory before\\nmoving to the darkroom of the United Newspapers' London office. In those\\ndays, United's newspaper interests were entirely provincial - the office\\nprovided a photographic service to the group's newspapers, led by the\\nYorkshire Post.\\nFrom the outset, Alan's aim was to be a photographer for a national daily\\npaper, and he moved to the Financial Times in 1981, again as a darkroom\\ntechnician.\\nHe revealed an early ability to get the most out of every negative, and\\ndisplayed a keen interest in all aspects of the photographic craft. It was\\ntherefore inevitable that time would bring an increasing number of\\nopportunities to move out of the darkroom. He became a full-time FT\\nphotographer in 1986.\\nAlan joined the paper's camera team at a time when there was still\\nuncertainty about the proper role of photographs in the FT, partly due to\\nthe poor reproduction of the presses at Bracken House, then close to the end\\nof their usefulness.\\nHis photographic confidence and fluency grew along with that of the paper,\\nhelped by the greatly improved reproduction of the new presses at East India\\nDock, opened in 1988. As scope for imaginative photography opened up, Alan\\nwas among the keenest of those seeking to take advantage of the new\\nopportunities to print and display pictures properly.\\nHe was best known, among his colleagues, for a fascination with political\\nphotography. A series of memorable pictures of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, as her\\nadministration drew to a close, capture both her undiminished zest for the\\nfray and the photographer's equally striking determination to outstrip his\\nprevious efforts in each successive portrait.\\nA second area of particular success was set-piece photography, where the\\nchallenge was not one of pushing shoulders with rivals from other newspapers\\nbut of thinking his way round technical obstacles. Colleagues recall a\\npicture of Canary Wharf taken from the British Telecom Tower (reproduced\\nabove) as a technical achievement of the highest quality; and readers will\\nperhaps remember a striking photograph of the new bridge that forms the\\nDartford crossing of the Thames in east London, published earlier this\\nmonth.\\nColleagues describe a modest, extremely energetic man, with a mischievous\\ndetermination that kept him permanently cheerful.

Mr Michael\\nO'Connor, director of the Coronary Prevention Group, said the government\\nwould be countering its own aims of improving the nation's health if it\\ncontinued to oppose EC proposals to ban cigarette advertising.\\nThe overall health of the British population, measured in terms of mortality\\nrates, is improving but there are still big regional and local variations.\\nHealth shortcomings are frequently associated with other social factors such\\nas poor housing and consequently economic circumstances. Although the\\nexplanations for health variations are complex, a number of recent studies\\nhave argued that there is a powerful link between the quality of health and\\ndeprivation.

His opponents are dismissed as heavily-financed\\n'fear-mongers' who practise 'defeatism'. His lieutenants in the cabinet are\\nbeing deployed en masse to congressional hearings to reiterate the\\nAdministration line.\\nThe Administration is arguing that the Nafta is a building block, not only\\nto a hemispheric-wide free-trade region, but to the President's vision of a\\n'New World Order'. Mr Robert Zoellick, the State Department counsellor, says\\nit sends a signal of encouragement to new Latin American leaders committed\\nto democracy and market economics.\\nMost of those opposed to the fast-track facility insist they are not so much\\nagainst increased trade with Mexico, even free trade eventually, as they are\\nthe fast-track procedure itself. They want to slow the process, bringing the\\ncontinent's three economies more in line as well as their regulatory and\\npolitical systems.\\nMr Mark Anderson, the AFL-CIO representative spearheading labour's fight\\nagainst the fast-track, contends that the negotiations are not so much about\\njobs as investment in Mexico, when investment is vitally needed in the US.\\nIf the Administration wants to help Mexico, he says, it should be providing\\nmore debt relief and foreign assistance.\\nDr Adolpho Aguilar, a visiting professor from Mexico at the American\\nUniversity in Washington, is another opponent of the Nafta.

The Congress\\nand the judicial system are controlled by a king who serves for six years\\nand chooses his own successor.'\\nThus far, there is little sign of a consensus emerging and observers say a\\ncongressional vote would be too close to call at this stage.\\nCompromise plans have found their way into the debate through Senator Donald\\nRiegle and Congressman Sander Levin, both from Michigan, where the motor\\ncompanies want the fast-track and unions oppose it. They propose to grant\\nthe fast-track for the Uruguay Round but allow a limited number of\\namendments to the Nafta. These would ensure congressional control over\\nissues of most concern: environment, rules of origin, health and safety\\nstandards and dispute-settlement mechanisms - issues opponents do not\\nbelieve they can trust the Administration to address.\\nThe Nafta would cause a mass exodus of low-skilled US manufacturing jobs and\\na deluge of exports (including food tainted by polluted waters and\\nunregulated pesticides) to the US produced by exploited Mexican workers.\\nReal wages in both countries would decline.

Iraq's\\nruling Ba'ath Party has seen its legitimacy undermined and its army weakened\\nby the hopeless war for Kuwait and the subsequent uprisings in Kurdistan and\\nthe predominantly-Shia Moslem towns of the south; as for the Kurdish\\nguerrillas, their continued military presence in the mountains is rendered\\npolitically pointless unless the mass exodus into Iran and Turkey of the\\nKurds who make up their constituency can be reversed.\\nMr Talabani and the Iraqi government say their proposed agreement is based\\non the lapsed 1970 autonomy deal which recognised the Kurdish language and\\ncultural identity, provided for Kurdish representation in government and\\ncalled for the economic development of Kurdistan.\\nMany Kurds, however - not to mention those non-Kurds who have espoused the\\nKurdish cause in recent weeks - are profoundly sceptical about the value of\\npromises made by President Saddam.\\nMr Talabani and his allies believe concessions can be squeezed now from the\\nweakened Iraqi leader and gains preserved by means of international\\nguarantees.\\nYet it is difficult to see the United Nations or any of its members agreeing\\nto enforce a purely domestic political arrangement. Nor has it escaped the\\nnotice of those who distrust Mr Saddam that one of his main objections to\\nthe proposed deal is the request for outside guarantors.\\nWhen pressed on the matter, Mr Talabani told a news conference in Baghdad:\\n'We think that democracy will be the main guarantee of the national Kurdish\\nobjective.' Kurdish autonomy, in other words, is supposed to be preserved by\\nthe presence of a democratically-elected and partly Kurdish government in\\nBaghdad.\\nThe regime has certainly been talking a great deal about the need for\\ndemocracy and reforms since the end of the war, and President Saddam has\\ntaken a back seat, in public at least, to Mr Saadoun Hammadi, the new prime\\nminister.\\nBut even those who sympathise with the Iraqi Ba'ath Party in its present\\npredicament find it hard to swallow the suggestion that President Saddam and\\nhis colleagues are about to steer Iraq towards genuine democracy after three\\ndecades of increasingly brutal oppression.\\nYesterday, with remarkable frankness, Mr Hammadi said that Iraqi steps\\ntowards democracy would be gradual and might not meet the immediate\\nexpectations of other countries.\\nOne of the reasons for the breakdown of the 1970 agreement within a matter\\nof years was the central government's reluctance to carry out a census in\\nthe Kirkuk area which would doubtless have shown a Kurdish majority.\\nSince then the authorities have 'Arabised' Kirkuk by transporting families\\nfrom the south, to such an extent that even Kurds believe that the Kurdish\\ninhabitants must be a minority of the population. Mr Talabani said the two\\nsides would discuss the matter of Kirkuk at a later stage.\\nLastly, there is the probability that a deal between the Kurds and President\\nSaddam will demolish the flimsy, 17-party anti-Saddam coalition which\\nfinally emerged after the Kuwait invasion.\\nThe Kurdish political parties are now trying to set their agreement in\\nconcrete while President Saddam is willing to talk, but anxious Kurdish\\nrefugees and cautious western governments could hardly be blamed for\\ndeclaring yesterday that they would wait and see.\"},\n",

The suggestions yesterday that Mr Valentin Pavlov, the\\nprime minister, was prepared to form some sort of coalition government,\\ncould also mean the adoption of some of the radicals' ideas.\\nAlthough the recent joint declaration between President Gorbachev and Mr\\nBoris Yeltsin may help provide the political support Prof Petrakov cited as\\na prerequisite for necessary reform, the programme still suffers from a\\nnumber of contradictions.\\nWhile calling for 'emergency budgets' to tackle runaway spending, the\\ngovernment plan does not spell out areas where cuts can be made, apart from\\ncalling for a moratorium on new spending. The 13-page analysis by Prof\\nPetrakov says an inventory of traditional expenditure would offer a real\\nchance of 'finding reserves' for budget cuts.\\nHe and other proponents of radical economic reform have consistently singled\\nout the military-industrial complex as an important source of inflation\\nbecause of the money printed to support it.\\n'Without a sharp decrease and redistribution of resources devoted to the\\nmilitary industrial complex, structural readjustment and anti-inflationary\\nmeasures are in general impossible,' says Prof Petrakov. He believes that\\nthis sector accounts for at least 15-18 per cent of GNP, compared to the\\nofficial figure of 6.4 per cent.\\nAs for the government's plan to liberalise prices by October 1992, he said\\nthis would cause galloping inflation in the absence of resolute measures to\\nbreak up and privatise state monopolies and overcome severe shortages.\\nTo deal with shortages, the government proposes tax incentives for\\nenterprises to produce more food and consumer goods, as well as the\\nprivatisation of two-thirds of small businesses by the end of next year.\\nWhile proclaiming the need to take medium and large-scale enterprises out of\\nstate hands (without a specific time-scale), Prof Petrakov says the state is\\nleaving itself ample room to interfere, both with the running of\\nenterprises, and their privatisation.\\nHe says that new bodies foreseen to handle privatisation must be made\\ncompletely independent of the government.\"},\n",

'Why don't you accept responsibility or,\\nbetter still, take action to reverse this recession?'\\nMr Major insisted that falling inflation and interest rates signalled an\\nearly recovery, but it is acknowledged privately that the government may be\\ndogged in the immediate future by rising unemployment totals.\\nSenior ministers are concerned that key public spending programmes, notably\\nhealth and education, face a financial squeeze just as the government is\\npledging an improvement in services in the run-up to the general election.\\nThe Treasury has signalled the start of negotiations covering next year's\\nspending with a lengthy warning to every Whitehall department that it will\\nbe seeking considerable savings elsewhere to offset the cost of higher\\nunemployment.\\nThe Pounds 205bn spending target for the 1991-92 financial year, which\\nstarted on April 1, includes a Pounds 3bn reserve for unforeseen\\nexpenditure. But unemployment is already more than 300,000 higher than the\\n1.75m assumed when the target was set. Even if there were no further\\nincrease, the cost to the reserve in higher unemployment and other benefits\\nis about Pounds 1bn.\\nAnother Pounds 320m of the reserve has been set aside to meet the cost of\\nhigher-than-expected deals in the health service and the armed forces. Pay\\ndeals in other areas of the public sector have been averaging 8 per cent,\\nwell above assumptions.\\nThe Treasury has acknowledged that its decision to raise child benefit will\\ncost Pounds 220m from the reserve, while the Department of Employment has\\nbeen allocated an extra Pounds 120m for training.\\nIronically, the Budget decision to raise VAT to 17.5 per cent will cost\\nWhitehall departments some Pounds 450m. Mr William Waldegrave, the health\\nsecretary, has secured agreement from the Treasury that the extra burden on\\nthe NHS will be met from the reserve.\\nOverall, the demands mean that half of the reserve has been spent, and about\\ntwo-thirds of the Pounds 3bn which was notionally available three weeks ago\\nhas been pre-empted. Another rise in unemployment could account for the\\nrest, since even the more optimistic forecasts point to a further 250,000\\nincrease this year.\\nThe outlook for next year - for which spending departments will submit their\\nbids by mid-May - is similarly bleak. In theory the Treasury has a Pounds\\n7bn reserve for 1992-93, but the increases this year will pre-empt half of\\nthat.\\nInflation will be sharply lower by next year, but that assumption is built\\ninto budgets for 1992-93. The allocations for the NHS and education, in\\nparticular, allow for only minimal real growth next year, suggesting the two\\ndepartments will seek several billion pounds more from the Treasury.\\nMeanwhile, Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, is expected to\\nneed at least Pounds 1.5bn in extra grants for local authorities to cushion\\nthe impact of the poll tax in what he has promised will be its final year.\\nThe new demands could wipe out the scope for tax cuts and force the Treasury\\nto revise upwards what many in the City see as an over-optimistic view of\\nthe likely trend in public borrowing.\\nKinnock rejects Major's optimism Page 13\\nAll-party warning on depth of recession Page 24\"},\n",

But it had no legal teeth, and\\nhad to rely on tact and persuasion.\\nIf this failed, the only recourse open to a person with a pension grievance,\\nand who could get no redress from a company scheme or an employer, was\\nthrough the courts - a time-consuming and often prohibitively expensive\\nexercise. The Pension Ombudsman, set up under the 1990 Social Security Act,\\nprovides a free, user-friendly service. He has wide statutory powers to\\ninvestigate and settle disputes.\\nThe government's original intention was that the ombudsman would handle all\\ncomplaints relating to private-sector pensions, including personal pensions;\\nbut subsequent regulations have required it to draw back from this\\nall-embracing concept. Nevertheless, he still has very wide powers. He can\\nadjudicate on complaints about injustice caused by maladministration, and in\\na dispute of fact or law.\\nA clearer idea of how Mr Platt is developing his role will emerge when he\\nmakes his first annual report. Nevertheless, any individual with a grievance\\nover pensions should not stop to consider whether or not it falls within the\\nOmbudsman's reference, but contact the bureau.\\nThe ombudsman cannot usurp the functions of the trustees in exercising their\\ndiscretions, such as the payment of a death-in-service benefit; but he can\\nensure that the trustees have operated within the rules of the scheme, and\\nthat they have taken all relevant facts into consideration.\\nAgain, the ombudsman cannot directly overrule the scheme actuary in the\\ncalculation of transfer values. But he can ensure that the actuary has\\nconformed to the professional guidelines in making the calculation, and that\\nthe basic details, such as length of service, are correct.\\nThe ombudsman has adopted the policy long followed by Opas, that no one\\nmaking a complaint will get a purely negative response. If he cannot deal\\nwith the complaint, then advice and guidance will be given as to whether\\nanother complaints body might handle it; or, failing that, the complainant\\nmay be given an explanation of his situation. For the ombudsman has\\nincorporated Opas into his operations, to handle the advisory and\\nconciliatory aspects of the service.\\nThe stages of handling a complaint are:\\n1, The complainant must first raise the matter with the trustees or managers\\nof the scheme.\\n2, If he or she fails to get satisfaction, then he should contact Opas for\\nhelp. If the complainant contacts Opas without having first raised the\\nmatter with the trustees or managers, Opas would tell him to do so, though\\nwould also give guidance on who to approach and how to raise the matter.\\nThis service is useful to a person who has a complaint or enquiry about\\nbenefits from a previous employer's scheme with whom he has had no dealings\\nfor some time.\\n3, Opas, through its countrywide team of voluntary advisers, would examine\\nand investigate the complaint. Most of the complaints so far received by\\nOpas arose through misunderstanding on the part of the complainant, or\\nmaladministration by the scheme, and can be resolved by explanation or\\nnegotiation. The complainant can go direct to the ombudsman, but the\\nombudsman will encourage him to go to Opas first.\\n4, Where Opas is not able to resolve the complaint, either through\\nunwillingness on the part of the scheme trustees or the complainant, or\\nbecause adjudication is required, then the Ombudsman will investigate the\\ncomplaint. He has the statutory powers to require schemes to produce\\ndocuments, explain their attitudes and decisions and attend hearings. He can\\nseek the guidance of the courts on points of law.\\nAbove all, his decision is binding on both the scheme and the complainant,\\nsubject to appeal on a point of law.\\nMichael Platt hopes it will be possible to handle most cases by letter. But\\nwhere necessary, he will have personal hearings, either separately with both\\nparties, or jointly with both present. Complaints must be made within three\\nyears of the matter's arising, though this can be extended if the facts were\\nnot known within the time, or if it was not practicable to complain within\\nthe time-limit.\\nThe ombudsman can deal only with individual complaints; so where there is a\\ngeneral complaint, such as occurred recently with the pensioners in the\\nImperial Tobacco pension scheme, a person must be selected to make a\\ntest-case complaint. Complainants can be legally represented, and the\\nOmbudsman has the power to award costs. But since this is not a tribunal, a\\ncomplainant cannot apply for legal aid.\\n*The address of both the Pensions Ombudsman and the Occupational Pensions\\nAdvisory Service is 11, Belgrave Road, London SW1V 1RB. But there are\\nseparate telephone numbers: the Ombudsman is 071 834-9144, and Opas 071\\n233-8080.\"},\n",

I'm going to live a long time, and I know that\\nspending money on insurance policies is not throwing it away.'\\nThe lack of provision made by a society that is rightly praised for its\\nverve and zest for life meant that, by the time General Francisco Franco's\\nprotective and paternalistic 39-year dictatorship came to an end in 1975,\\nSpain's savings rate was very low (statistically, it is traditionally high,\\nbut savings accounts are subject to quick turnover) and practically no\\nattempt was being made, beyond the banking and savings bank networks, to\\nattract saving.\\nLow savings are still a problem for the Spanish economy, making it rely too\\nheavily on the entry of foreign capital to finance its deficits. But,\\ninevitably, the existence of a virgin market of 35m people was not going to\\nbe left alone for long. From the moment the democratic authorities began\\nallowing foreign banks into the country, at the end of the 1970s, Spanish\\nhabits began, slowly, to change.\\nLife insurance was a particularly stubborn nut to crack, and it was only\\nwhen insurers began to market the fiscal advantages of their policies -\\nrather than the Anglo-Saxon notion of preparing for old age or unexpected\\ndeath - that people began to take notice. Still, by 1986, the industry had\\nmanaged to sell only 2.1m policies to a probably small stratum of people who\\nhad enough money to actually worry about how to avoid paying taxes. In\\ncontrast, the mainstay of the insurance industry, car insurance, accounted\\nfor nearly 12m policies.\\nThat picture has changed in the past four years. Car insurance has become\\nincreasingly unprofitable as Spain's crammed roads and impatient drivers\\ncause more and more accidents. But the rush of foreign entrants into the\\nmarket, smothering the television and newspaper advertising markets with\\nlife policies and pension plans, and quickly copied by local institutions,\\nhas bulldozed its way through fatalism, disbelief and suspicion.\\nBy the end of 1989, the number of life polices had more than doubled to\\n4.4m. Car insurance, meanwhile, had grown just 16 per cent to 14.8m\\npolicies. Where Spaniards were spending just Pta 11,000 a head on insurance\\nat the beginning of the 1980s, they were spending Pta 60,000 (Pounds 330) by\\nthe end of the decade.\\nAt the same time, a vicious battle was being waged between foreign and local\\nbanks, and local savings banks, to attract and, more important, hold on to\\nsavers. In late 1989, local banks finally laid their old interest-rate\\ncartel to rest and began to compete directly for rich savers - offering high\\ninterest-bearing current accounts on amounts over Pta 1m. That has been an\\nexpensive exercise for the commercial banks, and the big savings banks are\\nonly beginning to compete, having first been forced to leave the insurance\\nmarket.\\nBut while the growth of services and automation in Spanish banking has been\\nspectacular (one savings bank is working on machines that would enable\\npeople to buy and sell shares), the most telling measure of change has been\\nthe quick growth of personal-pension funds since the government first\\nallowed them to operate at the beginning of 1990.\\nIn their first year, about 150 new pension-fund managers were able to\\ngenerate Pta 85bn-worth of business, but no one dreamed they would double\\nthat by the end of last year, to some Pta 170bn. According to Mr Jose\\nMiracle, the government's pension-fund supervisor, 530,000 Spaniards now\\nhave their own pension plans. 'Its an incredible number,' he says. 'It's\\nclear that, in this country, a certain layer of people have come to regard\\nlong-term savings as an absolutely essential cover.'\\nWell, sort of. Talk to the Spaniards who are buying life policies and\\npension plans, and it quickly becomes clear why they are so attractive.\\nAlfonso Moreno, a rich young financial analyst, quickly bought into a\\npension scheme. 'I did it for fiscal reasons,' he says, meaning that what he\\nfound attractive about the schemes is that they allow contributions of Pta\\n500,000 to be fully deducted from income tax and that a further Pta 250,000\\nis 15 per cent deductable.\\nSo what about old age and all that? 'Look,' he says, 'I'm irresponsible. I\\nsuppose if I were married I would do it differently.'\\nIt is probably a reflection of their professions, but Alfonso Moreno and\\nJuan Jose Suarez approach buying their products in very different ways.\\nAlfonso says that, when he wants to borrow money (he has, truly, just bought\\na Porsche), he shops around. 'You can save up to two points,' he says. As\\nbanks vie for business, Alfonso's favourite stopping-points at the moment\\nare Barclays and the Caja de Catalunya, a Catalan savings bank.\\nJuan Jose says he makes a point of 'never asking about the interest rate,\\njust the length of time I have to pay the money back'. On the Pta 12m\\nmortgage he has just taken out? 'I got a good deal - 10 years  - but I don't\\nknow what interest I'm paying and I haven't asked.'\\nJuan Jose is probably the more typical Spanish borrower. Which probably\\nexplains why so many people are trying to lend him and the rest of the\\ncountry money. The sheer spread of offers at least means he is spoiled for\\nchoice and is not going to get ripped off too badly.\"},\n",

This was the one-off price needed to acquire the most\\nperfect example of the rarest and most desirable card in the market.\\nIt is a portrait of the baseball player Honus Wagner, a big name around\\n1910. Wagner was an ardent anti-smoker, and when he discovered that his\\nlikeness was being used to promote sales of cigarettes he asked the tobacco\\ncompany to withdraw the card. Fewer than 40 Wagner cards are known to have\\nsurvived, and less than 10 are in good condition. This one is the finest:\\nhence the price.\\nMost cigarette cards are virtually worthless. They were produced in their\\nbillions in the UK and the US from the 1880s up to the second world war. But\\nthey have always been collected, first by small boys, and now mainly by\\nmiddle aged men, nostalgic about their youth. (For some reason they have\\nminimal appeal to women). And the rarer sets, especially those of the\\npre-1920 period, go for fancy prices: the British record is the Pounds\\n17,050 paid at Phillips in 1987 for a set of 20 Taddy's Clowns.\\nThis was quite exceptional. Two rich collectors had been trying for years to\\nacquire these rare cards, of which only 15 complete sets are known, for\\ntheir holdings and they chased each other up in the saleroom. If a set of\\nTaddy's Clowns appeared on the market now, it would probably go for around\\nPounds 7,000 - the underbidder on the record price was soon able to complete\\nhis set, reducing the demand.\\nThe same fanaticism fuels the search for cards from an even rarer set,\\n'Tobacco Leaf Girls', Edwardian beauties who have maintained their appeal.\\nOne card could make Pounds 800; perhaps much more if two collectors need it\\nto complete the set of 20. The highest prices tend to be paid for the\\nearliest cards, such as 'Pirates', by the American manufacturers Allen &\\nGinter in 1888 and valued at over Pounds 300 a set. The only post-1930 set\\nto attract exceptional prices is the 'Life of Edward VIII', which\\ndisappeared from the streets as quickly as the monarch. A set might cost\\nPounds 1,500.\\nAround 15,000 sets of cards were issued in the UK. By the 1920s, Wills and\\nPlayers had bought out most of the smaller cigarette makers, like Taddy,\\nKinnear, Duke & Sons, Richmond Cavendish and Salmon & Gluckstein; and for\\nalmost two decades were pumping out annually new sets by the hundred.\\nToday, they can usually be bought for around Pounds 10 a set, with really\\npopular subjects, like the Kings and Queens of England, produced in massive\\nquantities in the 1930s, worth now around Pounds 5 - less if the cards are\\nstuck in one of the books published by the tobacco companies to encourage\\nloyalty to the brand. Serious collectors place their cards in protective\\nplastic covers. As well as rarity, condition is all-important: creased or\\ndog eared cards have minimal appeal.\\nThe low value of most cards means that, these days, the auction houses tend\\nto sell them in vast job-lots - if they sell them at all. Phillips still\\nincludes cigarette cards in its sales of books or collectables at its rooms\\nin Leeds, Ipswich, and Sherborne, as well as at London West Two. Christie's\\nSouth Kensington now has two substantial sales a year and confines\\nappropriate cigarette cards to specialist auctions - on such subjects as\\ncricket, fishing and aviation.\\nGenerally, a saleroom lot which contains a few rare cards and carries an\\nestimate of up to Pounds 100 sells at around its target. The lots containing\\nthousands of popular cards from mixed sets, and with estimates up to Pounds\\n300, sometimes make much more as dealers compete for the hoard. These cards\\nwill then be matched into sets and retailed at collector's fairs or street\\nantique stalls with a substantial mark-up.\\nThere are specialist dealers who tend to offer a postal service. They can be\\ntracked down through the periodical Card Times. But around 70 per cent of\\nthe lots at auction go to private buyers, who might do some weekend trading\\nof their spares to finance their hobby.\\nChristie's South Kensington noticed that prices in its October 18 sale were\\nappreciably higher than in the spring of 1990 when demand was weak: perhaps\\nthe cutback in the number of auctions had left the dealers short of stock.\\nThis would account for a job-lot of 129 complete sets, including many\\npre-1920, selling for Pounds 4,620, as against a top estimate of Pounds 500.\\nA Phillips auction in Leeds, in late February, also suggested a healthy\\nmarket. One lot, consisting of cards from FJ Smith's 'Cricketers' - as well\\nas 'War Incidents (First Series)' and 'British Butterflies', from Godfrey\\nPhillips - made Pounds 297, against a top estimate of Pounds 50. Twenty-four\\nfull sets of natural history and sport, conservatively estimated at up to\\nPounds 100, went for Pounds 407. It does not matter too much if a set is not\\ncomplete - it is usually possible to acquire from a dealer the missing\\ncards.\\nBut it is hard to predict price frenzy among the cigarette cards. The\\ncollectors are getting older; the likely frequency of rare cards appearing\\nfor sale is known; price levels have moved in line with inflation, but no\\nmore. Certain areas are perenially attractive to collectors, like cards of\\ncricketers, which have shown an impressive rise in value in the past decade.\\nThis has now levelled off. Boxers seem currently to be attracting attention,\\njoining Edwardian beauties as bankable propositions. Anyone with a little\\nsurplus income could form an impressive cigarette card collection quite\\nquickly and painlessly.\\nBut this misses the point. The attraction for enthusiasts lies in slowly\\nassembling sets in a particular area - sporting cards, military cards,\\npre-1910 cards, cards produced by lesser-known cigarette-makers - and\\npouring over the inevitable card stall at a boot-sale or at a Sunday morning\\ngathering of like-minded collectors, trading and exchanging until the\\nholding is complete.\\nFew areas offer the thrill of the chase with quite so many possibilities of\\nsuccess. And there is undoubted investment potential among the earlier,\\nrarer, cards.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2982, TEXT: THERE IS particular reason this year to ensure that the fund manager\\ninvesting your money has a long and steady record, and as much experience as\\npossible of volatile markets.\\nYet while the expertise of the individual managing the fund is fundamental,\\nthere is no real mystique about the investment business - the management\\nprinciples are much the same as for any other industry.\\nPaul Haines, investment director of consulting actuary Noble Lowndes, says:\\n'There have been no career changes in the last six months where people who\\nhave moved are so good that they could change my perception of an investment\\nhouse overnight. But some could change the house over a period of time.\\nSometimes the problem with a house is not the quality of the staff, but the\\nway the house is managed. If there was a house where the investment\\nphilosophy is sound but the management is poor, then a good leader can\\nprovide what the house is lacking.'\\nMr Haines also questioned the widely-held assumption that an investment\\ngroup necessarily suffers when a brilliant and charismatic manager leaves.\\n'If a manager is really exceptional, then he will train people in his\\nculture and that culture may persist beyond his own physical presence.'\\nThere are, however, two typical scenarios that are likely to take their toll\\non a group's fund performance.\\nThe first is where a group's traditional fund management department falls\\nunder the general business function, so that fund managers are remunerated\\non the same scale as managers in other departments. The best fund managers\\nin their field can demand far more than such a structure allows. This type\\nof structural problem occurs most frequently in insurance companies. The\\nsecond is where different parts of a group are being merged, either through\\ncorporate takeover or the internal rationalisation of one company - for\\nexample, the merger of a group's pension and unit-trust arms.\\nThat said, the appointment of one exceptional manager can boost client\\nconfidence in a group, which in turn works like a self-fulfilling prophesy.\\nAn example might be the former chief of Prudential Portfolio Managers, Giles\\nWeaver, who returned to his native Scotland in October to take up a\\ndirectorship at Murray Johnstone, with overall responsibility for UK\\ninvestment and pensions. Murray Johnstone has had mixed fortunes over the\\nlast 12 months. Funds under management fell by Pounds 700m in 1990; its\\nattempts at merger have so far proved fruitless; and last month it\\nstreamlined its operation with the redundancy of a further 20 staff.\\nHowever, the company claims it has not lost a single client since Mr\\nWeaver's appointment.\\nHill Samuel Investment Services (HSIS) has also experienced a bumpy 12\\nmonths. Last month, chief executive Derek Fitch took early retirement\\nfollowing the group's decision to restructure the company into two parts.\\nOne arm is now headed by John Penny and concentrates on life, pensions and\\nmortgage business; the other is led by John Bourke, and deals with private\\nclient services and offshore operations. One of the biggest blows to the\\ngroup was the departure in December of David Tilles and his team of four,\\nwho had managed the Marks & Spencer UK Selection Portfolio unit trust. They\\nleft to form Delaware International Advisers, taking the Pounds 13.5m M&S\\ncontract with them.\\nThis also followed the departure of HSIS former managing director David\\nBarker, who left in February 1990 to join Royal Insurance Asset Management\\nas managing director, with the brief to oversee all of royal's\\nfund-management functions.\\nAnother troubled house, Kleinwort Benson, appointed Charles Cavanagh last\\nmonth as director and head of UK institutional fund management. Mr Cavanagh\\nwas previously responsible for client relationships with UK pension funds at\\nMercury Asset Management.\\nNot all moves are from one house to another. In January, Kleinwort Benson's\\ncolourful Japanese unit trust manager, Campbell Gunn, moved to Switzerland\\nto manage private client funds from the company's Geneva office. His\\nposition has been filled by Mark Pearson, who also managed the Kleinwort\\nBenson Japanese Specialist trust and had worked alongside his predecessor\\nfor three years.\\nOther significant recent job-changes of note in the fund-management\\nfraternity include Jimmy West's move to Lazards as chief executive in\\nDecember, following the takeover of Globe Investment Trust by the Coal Board\\nPension Fund.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2983, TEXT: OFFSHORE MAY have become a more respectable place, but a number of its tax\\nadvantages have been whittled away. The latest move was announced in the\\nBudget, against offshore trusts.\\nSince 1981, it had been possible to set up an offshore trust to hold assets\\n -shares, for example  - which could then be sold free of capital gains tax,\\nso long as the money remained offshore. If it was ever brought back to this\\ncountry, tax would be charged, but meanwhile, the trust assets could\\ngenerate income on the full amount.\\nExisting trusts will still be able to benefit, but only so long as no\\nchanges are made and no capital is paid to a UK beneficiary. The proposals\\nalso mean that it will not generally be worthwhile setting up a new trust.\\nAn early victim of a Inland Revenue clampdown was the so-called roll-up\\nfund. Instead of paying out dividends to investors, roll-up funds would\\naccumulate them into the capital value of their shares. This turned a\\npotential income-tax liability into one of capital gains, which at the time\\nwas cheaper.\\nThis loophole was closed in 1984, when the Inland Revenue stipulated that\\nall gains - income and capital  - would be liable to income tax, unless the\\nfund qualified for what was called distributor status. The primary criterion\\nfor this was that the fund had to distribute at least 85 per cent of its\\nincome as dividends, on which investors would then be liable to income tax.\\nA more recent measure involved 'umbrella' funds. These are investment\\ncompanies that offer different classes of share, or sub-funds. Each is\\ninvested in a different area, typically a range of international stock\\nmarkets, bonds and currencies.\\nIt used to be possible to 'convert' shares from one sub-fund to another\\nwithout incurring capital gains tax. This was a significant advantage over\\nonshore unit trusts, where any switch, even between funds managed by the\\nsame group, counts as a disposal.\\nUmbrella funds have since been brought into line, and conversions will now\\nincur CGT if the gains are above the annual exempt allowance, currently\\nPounds 5,500.\\nSo are there still reasons for the UK investor to look offshore? Yes,\\nindeed.\\nWhile tax-avoidance may have been more or less ruled out, tax-deferral is\\nstill a useful possibility.\\nTake roll-up funds. Now that capital gains tax is charged at the same rate\\nas income tax, these are certainly back in the picture. There is still one\\ndisadvantage - as all gains attract income tax, the investor doesn't have\\nthe benefit of the Pounds 5,500 CGT allowance.\\nBut on the other hand, tax is not payable until the investor sells his\\nshares in the fund. So the liability can be deferred until, say, a time when\\nhis income-tax rate is lower. Better still, if he moves abroad, he may\\nescape tax altogether.\\nDistributor funds, meanwhile, leave the investor in much the same tax\\nposition as an ordinary unit trust. But here again, there is a brief period\\nof deferral, as income is paid gross and the tax bill arrives later, which\\nmay have cash-flow benefits. The one caveat is that distributor status is\\napplied for retrospectively - funds must submit their accounts to the\\nRevenue for approval at the end of the financial year. Failure could have\\nsignificant consequences for investors, which means in turn that funds are\\nlikely to be ultra cautious in their operations.\\nThe other reason for considering offshore funds is the variety of\\ninvestments they encompass. Although there are now over 1,300 UK authorised\\nunit trusts, there are still areas they do not cover; for example, property,\\ncommodities, currencies and futures-and-options contracts.\\nThis is due to change shortly, with wider investment powers being granted to\\nunit trusts, but offshore funds are likely to retain an advantage for a\\nwhile. First, several unit trust management groups are wary of moving into\\nthese areas, which they see as carrying greater risks and more\\nadministrative demands. Second, the offshore funds have experience and a\\nrecord.\\nMost of the funds that are readily available to UK investors are based\\nwithin Europe and offered by subsidiaries of well-known UK companies, such\\nas Fidelity, Schroder and MIM Britannia. With EC harmonisation, the\\ndifferences between these and onshore investments will inevitably blur.\\nMeanwhile, this could be a golden age for offshore investment, with\\nregulations in place to reduce risks, but still some tax and other\\nadvantages for the canny investor.\"},\n",

In each case, the client is\\neither a wealthy individual or a small, self-administered pension fund. All\\nthe fund managers stress that they are investing for the long term - 10\\nyears and more  - rather than short-term gain.\\nThe exercise started at the beginning of October last year. The portfolios\\ngiven here were struck as at the end of March, and will be reviewed again at\\nthe end of June.\\nCASH IS supposed to be king in times of recession and uncertainty. Yet to\\nhave been invested in cash during the past quarter would have meant missing\\nout on a dramatic rally in world share prices.\\nIn the three months since the five last reassessed their portfolios, the UK\\nmarket has risen by 16.5 per cent; continental European markets have risen\\nby an average of 13.8 per cent; the US market has climbed by 26.9 per cent\\n(in sterling terms) and Japanese equities by 20.5 per cent (again in\\nsterling).\\nTo varying degrees, all five correctly anticipated this upsurge in share\\nprices, chosing to buy equities at a time when the Gulf war had yet to break\\nout and the world economic and political outlook was very uncertain.\\nNow the war is long over, but economic uncertainties remain. The\\nprofessional investors now have to decide whether the rally in share prices\\nhas been overdone, particularly in the US, where small-company shares rose\\nby 42 per cent over the quarter, without any incontrovertible evidence that\\nthe country is out of recession.\\nHere is how the fund managers assess the outlook for the next quarter.\\nDouglas McDougall, at Baillie Gifford, is not altering his holding of UK\\nshares, in the belief that inflation and interest rates will fall further\\nduring the year, setting the scene for economic recovery. 'Profits and\\ndividends should not suffer too badly in the recession, and the equity\\nmarket is still reasonably valued despite his rise,' he says.\\nHe is selling his US stake - 12.5 per cent of the portfolio  - because the\\nmarket is, in his view, expensive and the prospects for economic recovery\\ndoubtful. The holding in continental European equities is increased from 20\\nto 25 per cent, and he takes a new 5 per cent holding in Japanese equities.\\nHe is also increasing his South-east Asia stake from 12.5 to 15 per cent and\\nhis holdings of cash and Japanese bonds (accounting for 15 per cent of the\\ntotal) are switched into long French government bonds, where yields of 9.2\\nper cent are to him 'attractive against recent and imminent inflation, and\\ncould fall substantially'.\\nPaul Myners, at Gartmore, is tinkering with the composition of his holding\\nof UK equities, which remains at 55 per cent of the portfolio. He wants to\\nincrease his weighting in small-company shares and, as a result, a fifth of\\nthe total portfolio is to be invested in small-company investment trusts.\\nFive per cent is to be invested in the capital shares of split-level\\ninvestment trusts.\\nHe reflects that he was wrong to have invested 7.5 per cent of the portfolio\\nin Deutsche Mark bonds, which rose by 2.4 per cent over the quarter. They\\nare being sold, and the proceeds used to take the stake in Pacific Rim\\nequities from 7.5 to 12.5 per cent of the portfolio, and to take a new 2.5\\nper cent holding in Japanese equity warrants. Otherwise, the portfolio is\\nunchanged.\\nSimon Toynbee, at Mercury Asset Management, candidly admits that markets\\nrose more quickly during the first quarter than he anticipated. 'Our\\ncautious stance three months ago (with 20 per cent cash), with hindsight,\\nwas not vindicated but was very appropriate at the time,' he reflects.\\n'After such a very sharp rise in all world stock markets, some degree of\\nconsolidation is expected over the next three months,' he says. 'The value\\nof UK equities is still modest, and on a longer term view we remain\\noptimistic. We are concerned about the high valuation of US equities and the\\nweakness of the Deutsche Mark which is unsettling the German stock market.'\\nThe aim over the next quarter is to take the UK weighting from 40 to 50 per\\ncent of the portfolio. Accordingly, the holding of UK gilts is being cut\\nback from 15 to 5 per cent after a quarter in which gilts rose by 7.7 per\\ncent. Cash is being reduced from 20 to 17 per cent, the 3 per cent being\\ninvested in Far East equities. Otherwise the holdings remain the same.\\nWithin the UK market, Mr Toynbee is looking to increase the portfolio's\\nexposure to those cyclical stocks that are sensitive to economic upturn: he\\nhighlights the quality engineering companies, and GKN in particular. He\\nnotes that sentiment towards smaller-company shares is improving, but says\\nit is important to buy companies with strong management and strong balance\\nsheets.\\nHoward Beaufort, at Newton Investment Management, is still cautious. 'There\\nis no point in rushing into anything just because the markets are going up,'\\nhe says. 'That is a recipe for disaster. I'm aiming to produce a real rate\\nof return and not to be a slave to the markets. Whatever the markets do now\\nI wouldn't have a single worry about the stocks I have here.'\\nHis cash holding, 33 per cent at the beginning of the year, is now down to 8\\nper cent, and bonds are down from 25 to 12 per cent. The cash released has\\nbeen invested in equities, which now account for 80 per cent of the\\nportfolio, against 42 per cent three months ago.\\nUK stocks - which account for 40 per cent of the total  - include Abbey\\nNational, British Gas, BTR, Fisons, Northern Foods, RTZ, Severn Trent,\\nShell, Unilever and Whitbread. In the US, he has just two holdings: Failure\\nGroup and General Electric. In other markets, he holds shares in: Ito\\nYokado, Schering, Alcatel Alsthom, Stet, Banco Popular, Roche and Nestle.\\nDavid Poole, at Singer & Friedlander, had the gutsiest stance back in\\nOctober when this exercise began. While the other investors had large cash\\nholdings, Mr Poole confidently put 80 per cent of the total into equities, a\\nstance subsequently vindicated by events.\\nThere are no major adjustments to his portfolio: his holding of UK equities\\ngoes up by 3 per cent to 63 per cent; continental European and US equities\\nare cut back slightly, as are European bonds and sterling cash; the exposure\\nto Japan and the Far East is adjusted marginally upwards.\\nIn the UK market, Mr Poole has started to switch from defensive Footsie\\nbusinesses into quality growth stocks, including well-managed second-line\\nstocks which have underperformed, particularly those with a bias to US\\nearnings, such as Dawson International and Coats Viyella. He has also bought\\na number of high-yielding convertible stocks, where dividend growth rate is\\nexpected to exceed that of the ordinary share.\\nNote that all the fund managers are considerably more optimistic than they\\nwere six months ago when this exercise began. They believe that a period of\\nconsolidation is ahead; and that the best value is still to be found in the\\nUK market.\"},\n",

After all, they were plainly such an attractive\\ninvestment, when compared with say unit trusts, that savers would surely\\ncome knocking at the door.\\nBut they didn't. Over the decades the private investors in many investment\\ntrusts died, or at any rate sold their shares, and the shares drifted to\\nwider and wider discounts against underlying assets. During the early 1980s\\nthe average discount regularly came close to 30 per cent.\\nAs prices drifted, investment institutions such as life-insurance companies\\nand pension funds came in to mop up the investment-trust shares. Usually\\nthey did not regard them as appropriate investments, but at a low enough\\nprice they were worth tucking away in institutional portfolios.\\nIn this way, the big funds often came to own 70 per cent of an investment\\ntrust's shares. This is the topsy-turvy situation in which the boards of\\nmany trusts find themselves, and they know that such trusts have little\\nfuture unless the balance is redressed. The takeover of the giant Globe\\nInvestment Trust last year, to be broken up by the pension funds of British\\nCoal, was yet another ghastly warning, if another were needed.\\nNow, nearly all the investment-trust managements accept that more effective\\nmarketing to personal investors is essential if the investment trust\\nindustry is to survive in anything like its present form.\\nIn the distant past, investment trusts were able to rely on stockbrokers to\\nmarket their products. The reward of the brokers was the commission on the\\ndeal, nowadays of something like 1.7 per cent on small bargains (it used to\\nbe rather less). But stockbrokers have in many cases tended to become less\\ninterested in private clients. Alternatively, they have sold unit trusts on\\na significantly bigger 3 per cent commission.\\nMeanwhile, larger and larger proportions of the long-term savings of the\\npublic over the years have gone into life insurance contracts and personal\\npensions, sold by intermediaries who receive even more lucrative\\ncommissions.\\nSuch products can be sold aggressively through advertising or through\\nmail-order shots, and even through 'cold calls' on a door-to-door or\\ntelephone sales basis. These rules have applied for many years now.\\nInvestment trust shares, on the other hand, have come under the tight\\nrestrictions which apply to the promotion of company shares in general, and\\nare designed to curb the activities of unscrupulous share pushers and\\n'boiler room' telephone selling operators.\\nBut now big changes are in the offing. The Securities and Investments Board,\\nthe top watchdog body for investments, has decided that investment trusts\\nshould be put more in line with alternative savings products. Investment\\ntrust savings schemes, at least, will soon be much more freely marketable to\\nthe public. The new regulations may come into force later this year.\\nSo far, investment-trust savings schemes have had to skate around the\\nexisting rules. Investment trusts have not been permitted to sell 'off the\\npage' using coupons, as unit trusts can. Rather, investment-trust management\\ncompanies have had to advertise brochures, which is selling at one remove.\\nStill, investment-trust savings schemes pulled in Pounds 91m during 1990, a\\n42 per cent increase on the 1990 figure, despite poor market conditions.\\nMoreover, investment trusts have already been given a role in personal\\nequity plans. They are on a par with unit trusts in this tax privilege,\\nwhich gives both of them something of an advantage over life insurance\\nproducts. The latest Budget changes will serve to widen the range of\\ninvestment trusts which can qualify for Pounds 3,000 peps.\\nNow, the investment-trust marketing men are gearing up to take on the rival\\nsavings media more directly. More and more, they are seeking to reach the\\npublic through independent financial advisers, the sort of intermediaries\\nwho sell life policies, pension plans and unit trusts. The trade body, the\\nAITC, has just hired a marketing executive with a brief to help member\\ninvestment trust companies to reach such intermediaries.\\nHowever, this means paying the same sort of commission levels - usually 3\\nper cent of a lump sum investment - that unit trusts have paid in the past.\\nThus there are pluses and minuses in all this for the investor. Investment\\ntrusts are starting to offer rather worse value for money, but on the other\\nhand the discount on assets is shrinking, which is very good for existing\\ninvestors and offers the promise of reduced share price volatility to future\\ninvestors too.\\nA further step has been taken by Foreign & Colonial, now the biggest\\ninvestment trust. In a pioneering deal with Skandia Life, its shares are\\nbeing used as the investment medium for life insurance and personal pensions\\nproducts.\\nThere is still, however, something like Pounds 15bn of funds of\\ninstitutional investors in the investment-trust market. If that pool of\\ncapital is to be replaced by private investors' money within a reasonably\\nshort period of time, the investment trusts' new marketing men are going to\\nhave to work very hard.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2986, TEXT: THE SPLIT-capital trust is definitely in vogue. Every other new\\ninvestment-trust issue seems to have several different classes of shares,\\nand such trusts now make up 10 per cent of the sector.\\nThe main reason for the revival - the previous heyday of split capital\\ntrusts was in the 1960s - is the ability of managers to structure the trusts\\nin ways that make them attractive to private investors. Income shares, in\\nparticular, appeal to the older investor. Allied to a personal equity plan\\n(Pep), such trusts can provide vital tax-free income.\\nSome trust managers have been able to exploit an element of the Pep rules,\\nwhich allows new issues to be transferred, without charge, into a plan\\nwithin 42 days of the first day of dealings.\\nThe rules allow investors to put the full Pounds 6,000 into a new issue Pep,\\nrather than the normal investment-trust limit of Pounds 3,000. Indeed,\\ntrusts launched at the end of last tax year allowed investors to place as\\nmuch as Pounds 12,000 into two Peps, one for the 1990-91 fiscal year and one\\nfor 1991-92.\\nOne interesting variant of the income shares was created in the recent\\nlaunch of the Contra-Cyclical Investment Trust, managed by Rea Brothers. The\\nincome shares will pay a very high initial yield, but will only be repaid a\\npenny in the pound when the trust is wound up in 10 years' time.\\nThe Contra-Cyclical share thus resembles a temporary annuity - with the\\nadvantage that, if the investor dies, his estate will still be able to sell\\nthe shares at the market price. With an annuity, death means the loss of the\\nentire investment.\\nThe price of most income shares follows a parabola - rising above asset\\nvalue in the first few years, and then falling back to par as the wind-up of\\nthe trust approaches. This can make them dangerous investments for the\\nunwary, who may be attracted by the yield when the price is high, without\\nrealising they will face a capital loss. However, this quirk can be used to\\nadvantage by investors with a large capital gains tax liability. They can\\nbuy income shares at the peak price and create an offsetting capital loss,\\nwhile enjoying the income.\\nIncome is not the only advantage that a split-capital trust can offer the\\nprivate investor. If all the income is being siphoned off to one class of\\ninvestor, that leaves all the capital growth to the rest.\\nOne class of shares that has become particularly popular in the recent\\nrevival is the zero-dividend preference share. As the name suggests, this\\nbrings no income but will normally be first to be repaid when the trust is\\nwound up. Barring a disaster, repayment will be at a level which guarantees\\nhealthy capital growth.\\nFor the small investor who has not used up his capital gains tax allowance,\\nthese shares offer an attractive tax-free gain. And even investors who have\\nalready used up their Pounds 5,500 CGT limit can use the shares to make\\ntax-free gains via a Pep.\\nThose willing to take larger risks may be interested in the capital shares\\nof split trusts. These promise substantial gains if stock markets, and the\\nmanagers of the trust, perform well.\\nCapital shares are highly risky. The normal split-capital trust structure\\nmeans that the capital shares will be worthless unless the assets of the\\ntrust grow - and sometimes they need to grow substantially. But modest\\ngrowth rates in assets - of, say, 7.5 to 10 per cent per annum - can often\\nmean a substantial multiple of the share price.\\nDifferent trusts use different combinations of these shares, but they\\nnormally revolve around the three basics - income, assured capital growth\\nand risky capital growth.\\nThe attraction of these share varieties has created substantial demand, with\\nthe result that many of the trusts trade at a premium to their net asset\\nvalue. 'I think the sector will grow, because of demand not only from\\nprivate investors, but also from institutional clients who want an income\\nstream,' says Lewis Aaron, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.\\nMr Aaron expects more trust launches, particularly towards the end of the\\ntax year, and more restructuring of existing trusts into split-capital form,\\nwith the aim of attracting institutional interest.\\nHowever, the continued health of the sector depends on demand being\\nmaintained and not swamped by oversupply. It may also depend on the stock\\nmarkets performing well enough to prevent any disasters, such as capital\\nshareholders recording a total loss.\\nIf disasters are avoided, and the managers show continuing creativity in\\ninventing new classes of shares with investor appeal, then the split-capital\\nsector is likely to be an important factor in propelling the investment\\nindustry into the next millennium.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2987, TEXT: THERE is a risk that investment trust savings schemes may lose their status\\nas one of the cheapest ways of buying into the stock market.\\nThe danger results from the trusts' attempts to widen their appeal by\\nselling via financial intermediaries.\\nIntermediaries have tended to favour unit trusts in the past, for the\\nunderstandable reason that they receive a 3 per cent commission for doing\\nso.\\nThe natural response is for investment trusts to do the same. A number of\\nmanagement groups have started to offer intermediaries a 3 per cent\\ncommission for introducing new client funds. One of the most recent to do so\\nwas the Scottish American Investment Company (Saints).\\nBut the payment of commission raises a number of difficult questions, many\\nof which are related to the concept of 'best advice' which intermediaries\\nare supposed to provide.\\nSaints, for example, has had to decree that all investors who buy shares via\\nlump-sum investments in the savings scheme will have to pay commission,\\nwhether they get advice from a financial intermediary or not.\\nOtherwise, intermediaries would be obliged, under best-advice guidelines, to\\ntell prospective investors to buy their shares independently.\\nThis is bad news for those who wanted to use the Saints scheme as a cheap\\nway of buying into the trust, since new investors, and not existing\\nshareholders, pay the commission. The difficulties do not end there. Some\\ndiscount brokers charge as little as 1.25 per cent for making a sale or\\npurchase of shares. Saints makes a Pounds 10 charge for selling.\\nSo buying and selling, say, Pounds 5,000 of shares through a discount broker\\nwould cost Pounds 125; but Pounds 160 through the Saints scheme. (Stamp duty\\nwould also be payable in both cases).\\nHow can it be 'best advice' for the intermediary to recommend the scheme in\\nsuch an instance? And for a small sum of Pounds 1,000, even a broker\\ncharging 1.85 per cent would be cheaper than the scheme.\\nIt has been argued that the trust's shares will go up, and that when the\\ninvestor comes to sell, he might well be paying 1.25 per cent of a much\\nlarger sum. A 3 per cent upfront charge could thus in the long run be\\ncheaper.\\nHowever, this is a difficult argument to sustain. Using a Pounds 1,000 sum\\nas an example, the investor would pay Pounds 12.50 upfront via a discount\\nbroker, against Pounds 30 via the Saints scheme. For the total of broker\\ncommissions to be larger than the Pounds 40 total of Saints charges, the\\nshares would have to rise in value to Pounds 2,280.\\nIt is hard to believe that the financial intermediary will make that\\ncalculation - and even if he did, he certainly will not be able to guarantee\\nsuch a rise. Of course, there is a significant danger that the shares could\\ngo down. In any case, it is hardly 'best advice' to tell clients to pay a\\nhigh charge upfront, given the time value of money.\\nBut the most telling argument that this system runs counter to 'best advice'\\nis the fact that not all investment trusts pay commissions. The investor who\\nbuys through the Saints scheme is starting off with almost a 3 per cent\\ndisadvantage, compared with the investor who buys via the savings scheme of\\nanother which does not pay commission. The charge in the Foreign & Colonial\\nsavings scheme, for example, is only 0.2 per cent.\\nThe investor will only be better off if Saints performs better than other\\ntrusts which do not pay commission. But how can the intermediary be sure it\\nwill do so? Past performance provides no proof. An investor who placed\\nPounds 1,000 in Saints on January 1, 1980, would have seen his capital grow\\n(ignoring dividends) to around Pounds 5,000; the same amount invested in\\nForeign & Colonial would have grown to over Pounds 8,000.\\nThe upshot of all this is that it is hard to see any justification for an\\nadviser's recommending a client to buy trust shares via a commission-paying\\nscheme. The private investor, if recommended a trust by an intermediary,\\nshould establish whether or not he is being charged commission.\\nIntermediaries want to make a living and put food on their family tables;\\nthat is understandable. But if private investors want to be charitable, they\\nshould give to charity; if they want to buy investment trust shares, they\\nshould use a non-commission paying savings scheme.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2988, TEXT: INVESTMENT TRUSTS have been steadily forced into specialisation over the\\nlast decade. The large general trusts, which were the flagships of the\\nindustry, have been whittled away by takeover and reconstruction.\\nInstitutional investors, rightly or wrongly, just did not perceive that the\\ntrusts' managers added value.\\nIn contrast, specialist trusts, by concentrating on investment areas that\\nare illiquid or arcane, can bring value to the institutional portfolio.\\nFor private investors, specialist funds are really the only way they can\\ngain access to emerging markets, such as Korea.

There are also other closed-end funds on offer which,\\nthough not officially deemed investment trusts, have many of the same\\nqualities. Many of these funds, which can be found in the Finance, Land\\nsection of the FT prices pages are dollar-based investments.\\nPerhaps the most successful specialist trust of all concentrates on a field\\nthat is closer to home. Electra Investment Trust concentrates on the\\nunquoted sector and, since the start of 1980, has outperformed the FT\\nAll-Share Index by almost 30 per cent and the FT Investment Trust Index by\\naround 8 per cent.\\nThe trust has some 70 per cent of its portfolio in unquoted investments and\\na wide geographical spread, with more than 40 per cent outside the UK. The\\nconcentration on unquoteds is both an advantage and a disadvantage: it means\\nthat the trust has a tendency to value its investments conservatively, which\\nmay underplay its strengths; but it also means that the asset value is less\\nvolatile.\\nVolatility is the problem for many specialised trusts. Not only is investing\\nin a niche area inherently more of a volatile business, but such trusts\\noften move to a premium to net assets in their early days, since they\\nrepresent one of the best ways for investors to gain access to what is\\nusually a fashionable area of the market.\\nWhen the area becomes unfashionable again, and prices drop sharply, the\\ntrust then falls to a discount, creating a 'double whammy' effect for\\ninvestors. Private investors need iron nerves before backing such a trust,\\nand should ensure that a specialised holding is part of a more diversified\\nportfolio.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2989, TEXT: WITH ALMOST 250 investment trusts on the market, investors face a\\nbewildering choice. Trusts vary according to their size, marketability,\\ngeographical spread, the industries which they target, and crucially of\\ncourse their investment performance.\\nNo one can accurately predict which will do best over the next few years.\\nThe past can certainly be a useful guide to the future but with so much\\nspecialisation these days investment fashions count for at least as much. It\\nis obviously advisable to try to identify trusts or management companies\\nwith a consistent record - but it is worth remembering that the individuals\\nwho run them are also human beings: they can make mistakes, lose their\\ntouch, or suddenly embark on a huge and expensive gamble.\\nThe first thing to be clear about when selecting a trust is the nature of\\nyour aims. Are you, for example, primarily interested in income or in\\ncapital growth? Trusts have tended to become more growth-orientated of late,\\nbut there are nine UK funds whose policy is to accentuate income growth, and\\nfour which aim to achieve the same result with a more international spread\\nof assets.\\nThe AITC's monthly information service shows the up-to-date distribution of\\nthese assets. At the end of January, for example, the giant British Assets\\ntrust had 79 per cent of its portfolio in the UK, with 18 per cent in North\\nAmerica and 2 per cent in Japan. Murray International,on the other hand, had\\n54 per cent in the UK, 22 per cent in North America, 11 per cent in the Far\\nEast, and 12 per cent in continental Europe.\\nUK General Trusts generally try to achieve a balanced return. The nine\\ntrusts in this category were typically quoting gross yields of between 4 and\\n6 per cent at the end of January, roughly equivalent to the stock market as\\na whole. Split-capital trusts have two classes of shares: income\\nshares,which receive all the income from the trust's portfolio, and capital\\nshares which receive no income but get all the capital gains. The latter are\\nobviously attractive vehicles for those investors anxious to avoid liability\\nto income tax.\\nThe bulk of trusts tend to be orientated towards capital growth, in part\\nbecause the long years of inflation followed by rising stock markets formed\\nthe impression that this was the more attractive option. The increasing\\ntrend towards specialisation in individual overseas markets, where yields\\ntend to be low, has also led management groups to concentrate less of their\\nenergies on providing a generous income flow.\\nThe categories established by the AITC indicate fairly precisely to the\\ninvestor what he or she is buying: everything from the Far East, including\\nor excluding Japan, to technology, smaller companies, commodity and energy,\\nEurope and Australasia. The requirement for inclusion in most of the\\ncategories is that a trust should keep at least 80 per cent of its assets in\\nthe country, region, or sector in question.\\nThose who want a broad spread of international investments, and do not wish\\nto be confined to a specific market or region, will find plenty of choice\\namong the international general and international growth trusts. The\\nadvantage of this is that market exposure, as well as individual stock\\nselection, can be left in the hands of the investment managers.\\nIn essence, the key to choosing an investment lies in identifying the\\nappropriate degree of risk. For a first-time buyer with limited funds, a UK\\ntrust offering a reasonable yield is probably the best bet: the income flow\\nprovides some protection in falling markets, and the danger of adverse\\ncurrency movements can be ruled out.\\nHigher risk - but potentially greater rewards  - can be confronted in the\\nform of more specialised vehicles,notably those which have high gearing (ie,\\nborrowed money to buy additional shares in the hope that the rise in their\\nvalue will exceed the borrowing costs). Depending on the market's\\nperception, the level of gearing can contribute to swings in the\\ninvestment-trust discount - the difference between a trust's assets value\\nand share price, and thus an important influence on the investor's return.\\nAn interesting variant in recent years has been the zero-coupon preference\\nshares issued by investment trusts. These first appeared when Scottish\\nNational Investment Trust reorganised in 1987, and there are now 14 such\\nissues. The trick is that they offer a fixed growth in capital over a set\\nperiod.\\nAs with the capital shares of ordinary split-capital trusts, investors\\nreceive no income but are entitled to complete repayment before all other\\nclasses of equity when the trust reaches its winding up date - provided,\\nthat is, the assets are there in the first place. The lives of the 12\\nexisting issues vary from four to 10 years. Olliff and Partners, a\\nstockbroking firm which specialises in investment trusts, recommends using\\nthe zero-coupon preferences as a means of planning for school fees.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2990, TEXT: THE INVESTMENT-trust sector did quite well out of the changes in Personal\\nEquity Plans announced in the Budget. The chancellor agreed with one of the\\nmain proposals submitted by the Association of Investment Trust Companies -\\nthat Pep investments should no longer be confined primarily to the London\\nmarket but extended to include the whole of the European Community.\\nThis change, which takes effect in the autumn, should make Peps less risky.\\nOne criticism has been that they are too dependent on the UK market.\\nThe freedom to enter a range of markets should help investment trusts in\\nparticular. They tend to be less concentrated than unit trusts, preferring\\nto spread investments over a wider area. Many general investment trusts,\\nwhich were unwilling to change their strategy just to please Pep investors,\\nwill now qualify under the Pep regulations.\\nMichael Hart, chairman of the AITC, for example, said his company, Foreign &\\nColonial, would now be able to offer Pep investment trusts. Several other\\ncompanies will be able to broaden the range of trusts available to Pep\\ninvestors. Mr Hart said the AITC had long been lobbying the government to\\ninclude EC exchanges in the Pep scheme.\\nThe chancellor made another concession that will mainly benefit investment\\ntrusts, rather than unit trusts: the decision to raise from Pounds 900 to\\nPounds 1,500 the amount that can be put into a 'non-qualifying' trust - that\\nis, a fund that fails to comply with the rule that at least 50 per cent of\\nits investments should be in the UK (EC from the autumn) market.\\nThis is good news for investment-trust companies, which are prepared to deal\\nin fairly modest amounts at low charges, unlike the unit-trust groups which\\ndon't want to bother with such small sums.\\nOn the other hand, the chancellor closed a small loophole, available to\\ninvestment-trust Peps exclusively: the freedom to use their status as a\\nquoted company to make unlimited rights issues, thereby increasing the\\namount that could be invested well over the permitted maximum. But he left\\nopen the other, more widely used, loophole, again confined to investment\\ntrusts as quoted shares, of launching new issues, where the investor can\\nsubscribe Pounds 6,000 instead of being restricted to the normal Pounds\\n3,000 maximum investment for investment and unit trusts.\\nHowever, there was disappointment that he ignored pleas from both\\ninvestment- and unit-trust companies that investors be allowed to put all\\ntheir Pep money into a collective investment fund, rather than just Pounds\\n3,000. In fact, a step has been taken in the opposite direction with the\\nplan to allow a further Pounds 3,000 to be invested in a single-company Pep.\\nThis means that investors using the full Pounds 9,000 allowance will be able\\nto put only one third into a collective investment fund - the safest vehicle\\n -while being encouraged to take the gamble of putting a similar amount into\\nonly one company. A professional adviser who recommended a similar strategy\\nwould quite rightly be rebuked by the regulatory authorities for failing to\\ngive 'best advice'.\\nMr Hart said that investment trusts seemed to be beating their heads against\\na brick wall, with the politicians arguing that the purpose of Peps was to\\nencourage investment in industry, not in funds.\\nNevertheless, Peps are still seen as a good opportunity for investment\\ntrusts to attract new business, with the tax concessions as the lure. David\\nSmith, of Flemings, welcomed all moves to widen share ownership. Robin\\nBerrill, of Hendersons, said an 'enormous new marketplace' had opened up.\\nUnfortunately, unit trusts have so far grabbed the lion's share of the Pep\\nmarket. This is partly because the restrictions on Pep investments has made\\nthem unsuitable for most of the big general investment trusts, which like to\\nspread their portfolios worldwide, and have therefore been unable or\\nunwilling to become qualifying funds. The inclusion of the EC exchanges will\\nlessen that problem.\\nAt the same time, while investment-trust charges may be lower than those of\\nunit trusts, running a Pep does involve extra costs. This means that an\\ninvestment trust's Pep is slightly more expensive than its regular savings\\nscheme, which is undoubtedly the cheapest way to get into the stock market.\\nSo anyone considering investment trusts may well prefer to forget the Pep\\ntax concessions and go for a savings scheme instead.\\nUnit trusts adopt a different strategy, relying on marketing and promotion,\\npaid for out of their existing higher charges, to achieve the volume of\\nsales needed, so that they can sell Peps with no additional charges,\\nabsorbing the higher costs involved.\\nBecause of the restrictions on advertising shares, investment trusts have\\nbeen unable to promote themselves in the same way as unit trusts, and this\\nhas affected their efforts to sell Peps. So has the fact that most do not\\npay commission to independent intermediaries, who are therefore reluctant to\\nrecommend their products.\\nHowever, things are changing. The restrictions on advertising may soon be\\nlifted, and several investment-trust groups are now paying commission. At\\nthe same time, intermediaries charging fees are increasingly recommending\\nPep investment trusts, which have special advantages. For example, the\\nsplit-level trusts can offer Peps that provide a high income which makes the\\nmost of the tax-free dividends.\\nWith lower charges, and funds well suited to the small investor seeking a\\nsafe haven in the stock market, investment trusts should be in a powerful\\nposition to sell Peps strongly. The problem is in getting the message\\nacross.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2991, TEXT: THE PERFORMANCE of investment trusts in 1990 offers a salutary lesson to\\ninvestors: that the search for short-term profit may end with fool's gold.\\nAverage net asset values in the sector fell 25 per cent over the year -\\nunderperforming the FT-A All-Share index by 11 per cent. Of 206 trusts\\ntracked by brokers County NatWest Woodmac, only 39 managed to beat the\\nAll-Share. And only one trust in this sample, F and C Enterprise, was able\\nto maintain its share price over the 12-month period. Explanations for this\\ndismal showing are easy enough to find. The strength of the pound, which\\ngained significantly against most major currencies like the dollar, the yen\\nand the Deutsche Mark, hit the value of trusts' overseas assets on\\ntranslation into sterling.\\nThe relatively poor performance of overseas indices, meanwhile (notably\\nthose of Japan and other Pacific Basin countries), inevitably prejudiced the\\nreturns of investment vehicles which had 50 per cent of their assets\\noverseas at the start of last year.\\nLooking at performance over a longer time-frame restores the morale of fund\\nmanagers, and provides the main justification for investment in investment\\ntrusts. Figures from the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC)\\nindicate that the sector as a whole has shown banks and building societies a\\nclean pair of heels, looked its unit-trust rivals squarely in the eye, and\\ngenerally kept pace with the UK stock market as measured by the All-Share\\nindex.\\nOn average, for example, a Pounds 100 investment in a UK general investment\\ntrust grew to Pounds 175 in the five years to last December, or almost\\nPounds 475 over the 10-year period to end-1990. Leaving the money in a\\nbuilding society over these periods would have left the investor with just\\nPounds 155 and Pounds 239 respectively, while he would have been even worse\\noff in a bank deposit account.\\nThe AITC monthly figures (available from financial advisers, stockbrokers,\\nor direct from the Association) are the best source of comparative\\nperformance statistics. Two main yardsticks are used - share-price total\\nreturn, and net-asset-value total return, which in each case is a measure of\\nthe combined performance of the capital growth and income.\\nThe share price is what investors pay for their shares in the market. The\\nNAV is the current value of the assets backing each ordinary share issued by\\nan investment trust: it comes after deduction of all the liabilities due to\\ncreditors, and all capital with a claim to repayment ahead of ordinary\\nshareholders.\\nMovements in net asset values are useful, because they arguably show more\\naccurately than share prices the skill, or otherwise, of the investment\\nmanager. Share prices, on the other hand, represent the actual value of an\\ninvestment to the shareholder in the market, and may therefore be deemed a\\nmore appropriate guide.\\nThe difference between the share price and net asset value is known as\\neither the discount or the premium. At their simplest, these are a\\nreflection of the imbalance between supply and demand for investment-trust\\nshares, and can have a major impact on performance.\\nLast year, for example, a 4 per cent premium for trusts investing in the\\nemerging markets of Asia had turned into a 17 per cent discount at the end\\nof last year as investor enthusiasm waned. This year, by contrast, has seen\\na revival of interest in small companies, and investment trusts have been\\nidentified as a means of buying exposure to the sector. Trusts like TR\\nSmaller Companies have seen their discount narrow, while Kleinwort Smaller\\nCompanies and Aberforth Trust shares have both been on a premium in recent\\nweeks.\\nIt cannot be said often enough that past performance is not necessarily a\\nguide to the future. One-year figures, although keenly watched by investment\\nmanagers themselves and publicised in the press, are less reliable than\\nfive- and 10-year statistics when it comes to gauging a trust's consistency.\\nCertainly, trusts with general investment objectives can be usefully judged\\nin this way, though the potential for takeover or re-rating in a high\\ndiscount should not be overlooked when it comes to making a choice.\\nApart from looking at performance in isolation, it is as well to put trust\\nrecords into perspective. The normal yardstick is the FT-A All-Share index,\\nwhich reflects how the UK stock market as a whole has behaved. The advantage\\nof this is that it is well understood by the majority of investors. The\\ndrawback is that, with many trusts largely or even wholly invested outside\\nthe UK, it is not a particularly fair or meaningful comparison.\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         THE TOP 20 PERFORMERS: END FEBRUARY 1991\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(total return on Pounds 100, income reinvested)\\nFive years                            Ten years\\nCandover                 471.5        Capital Gearing          1,519.3\\nCapital Gearing          404.7        Lowland                  1,177.5\\nGT Japan                 291.0        TR City of London          829.6\\nMartin Currie Pacific    268.4        F&C Eurotrust              793.9\\nNew Throgmorton\\n(1983) - inc             264.2        English National  - def    787.7\\nPacific Assets           263.4        Securities Trust of\\n                                      Scotland                   785.0\\nDrayton Far Eastern      261.4        Fleming Japanese           770.9\\nRights & Issues - inc    257.4        GT Japan                   762.6\\nTR City of London        244.7        Law Debenture Corp         746.2\\nEnglish National  - def  243.3        Murray Income              745.7\\nEnglish National - pfd   232.0        English National - pfd     735.6\\nRights & Issues  - cap   228.1        Bankers                    732.2\\nFleming Claverhouse      226.2        Fleming Enterprise         716.0\\nGovett Oriental          225.5        Fleming Claverhouse        703.0\\nCity & Commercial - inc  224.7        Second Alliance            690.3\\nSecurities Trust of\\nScotland                 224.0        Murray Smaller Markets     683.9\\nLaw Debenture Corp       223.3        Dunedin Income Growth      670.4\\nMerchants                223.2        Alliance                   658.7\\nForeign & Colonial       217.6        Fleming Far Eastern        642.3\\nFleming Enterprise       216.6        Merchants                  625.5\\nAverage                  182.2        Average                    549.2\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSource: Association of Investment Trust Companies/County NatWest WoodMac\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\"},\n",

The trust itself will have a large\\nportfolio of perhaps 20 or 30 shares - a range which, as a small individual\\ninvestor, you could not possibly duplicate on your own, as the stockbroking\\ncharges involved would be prohibitive.\\nBut with a pooled investment, such as a trust, you buy a proportion of this\\nportfolio. There may be some bad performers - for example, quite a few fund\\nmanagers had British & Commonwealth in their portfolios at the time of the\\ncompany's collapse - but at least they can be counter-balanced by healthy\\nshares.\\nHowever, there are important differences between investment and unit trusts,\\nwhich investors should take into consideration.\\nAn investment trust is really a listed company that owns a portfolio of\\nshares. It is known as a closed-end fund, because the size of the portfolio\\ncannot be increased by simply selling new shares. Investors can only buy or\\nsell shares among themselves. As with any other company on the stock\\nexchange, supply and demand have an important influence on the share price.\\nBecause of this, the price of shares in an investment trust is very rarely\\nthe same as the value of its underlying investments (known as the net asset\\nvalue, or NAV). Normally the share price will stand at a discount to NAV,\\nalthough if this gets too wide, predators may be attracted.\\nA unit trust is an open-ended investment, which means that its total size is\\ndetermined by the number of investors willing to buy units, which are bought\\nand sold from the managers.\\nEvery time someone buys new units in the trust, the managers need to buy new\\nstock to increase the size of the portfolio; and when investors sell their\\nunits the reverse is true. So, when there is a stock market crash, as in\\n1987, and small investors panic and sell their units, it means that the\\ntrust managers have to sell off a substantial part of the portfolio. The\\nvalue of the units always reflects the value of the underlying investments.\\nThe most visible difference between these two forms of collective investment\\nis performance. The accompanying table shows that, on average, investment\\ntrusts have tended to outperform unit trusts. Why?\\nOne reason is the charges. A unit trust usually makes a front-end charge of\\nbetween 5 and 6 per cent, and an annual management fee of between 1 and 1.5\\nper cent for equity-based funds (to be fair, money-market funds tend to have\\nmuch lower charges). These high charges are used partly to cover the cost of\\nmarketing unit trusts. With an investment trust, you pay stockbrokers'\\ncommission to buy the trust shares, and the annual management charge is\\nabout 0.5 per cent. This means that, over one year, unit trusts invest far\\nless of your money in shares than investment trusts, so that the difference\\nin performance is particularly pronounced. The affect accumulates over a\\nlong period, as more of your money is actually invested in the stock market\\nby an investment trust than by a comparable unit trust - in other words,\\nless is eaten away by management charges.\\nAnother important point to bear in mind is that investment trusts have more\\nfreedom when it comes to how they invest their funds. An investment trust,\\nunlike a unit trust, is allowed to borrow against its assets or 'gear up'.\\nThis means that when stock markets are at low levels - as they were, for\\nexample, during the Gulf crisis - investment-trust managers can borrow money\\nin order to buy cheap shares. Gearing can be risky, however, in a falling\\nmarket, as some trusts discovered at the time of the 1987 crash.\\nUnit-trust managers, on the other hand, cannot gear and are often faced with\\nhaving to sell part of the portfolio when unitholders redeem their units in\\ntimes of crisis.\\nInvestment trusts are allowed to invest in a wider range of shares,\\nincluding those in smaller markets and in unquoted companies. For example,\\nwhen eastern Europe started to open up to western investors about 18 months\\nago, unit trusts were restricted to investing in quoted European companies\\nwhich stood to benefit from increased trade or business ventures in eastern\\nEurope. Investment trusts, on the other hand, were free to invest in actual\\neastern European ventures.\\nObviously such investments are risky. However, given that unit trusts must\\ninvest in shares which are easy to dispose of, in case unitholders suddenly\\nliquidate their holdings, investors who are particularly interested in small\\nspecialist markets will find a wider selection of funds available in the\\ninvestment-trust sector.\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n             AVERAGE PERFORMANCE COMPARED (TO END FEB)\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                               1     3     5\\nSector                         yr    yrs   yrs\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nInternational\\ncapital growth:\\nInvestment trusts             -3.3  38.9  79.0\\nUnit trusts                  -14.2  13.1  33.5\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nInternational\\nincome growth:\\nInvestment trusts              4.8  50.5  94.1\\nUnit trusts                  -11.3  11.8  27.2\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nUK capital growth:\\nInvestment trusts             -8.6  11.1  92.8\\nUnit trusts                  -12.8   0.5  40.5\\nUK income growth:\\nInvestment trusts             14.1  52.7 106.7\\nUnit trusts                   -5.3  14.8  69.5\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNorth America:\\nInvestment trusts            -10.5  30.5  23.0\\nUnit trusts                   -9.0  18.2   7.8\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJapan:\\nInvestment trusts             -4.4  14.8  93.2\\nUnit trusts                  -21.7  -2.3  77.3\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nEurope:\\nInvestment trusts            -12.5  64.1  52.9\\nUnit trusts                  -15.6  40.0  46.2\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFigures are % growth.

       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2994, TEXT: AFTER LONG years on the fringes of the retail investment business,\\ninvestment trusts are currently staging a vigorous fight to regain the\\ncentral position they commanded decades ago, until upstart financial\\nproducts such as unit trusts and personal pension plans came along.\\nMany of the investment-trust managers have come to the conclusion that they\\nhave little future unless they find ways of appealing once again on a mass\\nscale to the private investor, or to the intermediaries who advise him.\\nThat was the clear lesson of the takeover of Globe Investment Trust last\\nsummer. The Pounds 1.1bn flagship of the investment trust industry was\\nmopped up for cash by the pension funds of British Coal, which saw the\\nmighty fund simply as an easy vehicle for channelling huge sums into the\\nstock market.\\nAlthough Globe attempted to whip up enthusiasm among its private\\nshareholders, it proved to be fatally weakened by the huge build-up of\\ninstitutional holdings over the years. More than 70 per cent of its shares\\nby the end were owned by institutional investors, chiefly pension funds, and\\nthey were quite happy to get out at something close to underlying asset\\nvalue.\\nFor other investment trusts, the demise of Globe has had its compensations.\\nThe removal of some 5 per cent of the sector at a stroke eliminated an\\nimportant part of the excess supply; and with demand for equity investments\\nreviving strongly this spring, the average investment-trust discount has\\nfallen to some 12 per cent, the narrowest for many years.\\nBut it would have been much better, from the investment-trust sector's point\\nof view, to have removed the surplus by stimulating demand rather than by\\ncutting supply. That is the task upon which the industry is now embarked. At\\nleast some 30 new trusts were floated last year, but they were mostly highly\\nspecialised, and often quite small.\\nIn recent years, investment trusts have gained a reputation as the informed\\nsaver's preferred vehicles, while less experienced investors have been\\ndirected towards unit trusts or life assurance policies. Long-term savings\\nare usually sold rather than bought, and in the noisy environment of retail\\ninvestment the voice of investment trusts has only been dimly heard. But now\\nthe publicity drive is being stepped up.\\nIn the past 10 years, the typical investment trust has turned Pounds 1,000\\ninto some Pounds 5,000, including reinvested net income. The average unit\\ntrust would only have produced Pounds 4,000 over the same period. That is a\\nmessage that is worth proclaiming.\\nNew opportunities are also arising. The introduction of personal equity\\nplans, especially in their latest form, has given investment trusts the\\nchance to sell up to Pounds 3,000 each year per investor with benefit of a\\ntax shelter. And soon the curbs on selling investment trusts 'off the page',\\nthrough clipped coupons, will be largely abandoned, at least in respect of\\nthe savings schemes now operated by most of the investment-trust management\\ncompanies.\\nWhen the new rules of the Securities and Investments Board come into effect\\nlater this year, it will be possible to sell most investment trusts in\\nexactly the same way as unit trusts are marketed.\\nThere remain significant differences: investment trusts are more volatile in\\ntheir share prices, but offer lower costs and generally higher performance.\\nIt is possible to offer more complex structures than for unit trusts, for\\ninstance split-capital funds, which can offer certain advantages, though\\nwith the risk of confusing amateur investors.\\nYet some of the barriers are breaking down. Indeed, most investment trust\\nmanagers are heavily involved with unit trusts as well.\\nFrom the point of view of the private investor, the significance of these\\ndevelopments is that he is likely to see increasing promotion of investment\\ntrusts. Traditionally, they have only been available through stockbrokers,\\nbut other outlets, for instance independent financial advisers, are also\\nopening up. And many investment trusts will now also sell directly to the\\npublic.\\nBut investment trusts have a big mountain to climb. They have total assets\\nof rather more than Pounds 20bn, but probably only a quarter of that\\nrepresents the holdings of private individuals.\\nIn contrast, unit trusts are worth over Pounds 50bn, and although they have\\ninstitutional investors too, so that individuals probably own only about\\nPounds 30bn worth, that is still five times the effective size of the retail\\ninvestment-trust sector.\\nThe dominance of the big, institutional investors has caused a reshaping of\\nthe investment-trust business. Big general funds, like Globe, have tended to\\nbe vulnerable to takeovers, and there has been a growth of smaller,\\nspecialised funds.\\nBut big, general, low-cost and low-risk funds would make much more sense to\\nthe average private investor, so long as ways could be found of stimulating\\nregular demand, so that sellers could be balanced by buyers. Otherwise,\\nthere would always be a serious risk that the share price could slip back to\\na big discount.\\nBesides savings schemes, which include regular instalment plans, perhaps\\nunder the umbrella of a personal equity plan, there is also the possibility\\nof linking investment trusts to personal pension plans and life-assurance\\ncontracts. Foreign & Colonial, now the biggest investment trust at just over\\nPounds 1bn, is exploring these latter opportunities through a link with\\nSkandia Life.\\nYet there is a paradox in such developments. In competing with rival savings\\nmedia, investment trusts run the risk of being forced to adopt similar cost\\nstructures. For example, savings schemes were originally launched as being\\ncheaper than dealing through stockbrokers, but some of them now charge a 3\\nper cent front-end fee which goes to intermediaries. This makes them\\nactually more expensive than going through a stockbroker, though not yet\\nquite as costly as unit trusts.\\nIn moving from a dimly-lit corner of the bargain basement to the shop\\nwindow, investment trusts are gaining sales but are not necessarily offering\\nbetter value for money.\"},\n",

Even innocent transactions\\ncan take great bites out of your investments, if you are not careful.\\nHard-won investment gains have a habit of seeping away through management,\\ndealing and other charges.\\nAttention to detail and a willingness to read the small print helps. But\\neven that is not proof against unexpected loss.\\nMr Ron Boyce, a part-retired civil engineer from Hayling Island, is a\\nsmall-print reader. He is well-informed and has a healthy degree of\\nscepticism when it comes to trusting other people with his money. Yet Mr\\nBoyce and his wife, Sheila, still managed to see a large chunk wiped off\\npart of their investment portfolio during what should have been a routine\\ninvestment operation.\\nMrs Boyce had held unit trusts managed by Prolific for four years when she\\nand her husband decided to switch the investment into a personal equity plan\\n(Pep) in February. Yet the deal ended up wiping 8.7 per cent cent off the\\nvalue of their investment, even after a special discount from Prolific.\\nThe Boyces did not make any serious errors, and Prolific did not rip them\\noff. They were just the victims of what can often be costly inefficiencies\\nin the investment markets.\\nAt the root of the problem is the fact that it is not possible to transfer\\nexisting investments into Peps - they have to be sold and bought back. Also,\\nunder Financial Services Act rules, there has to be a seven-day 'cooling\\noff' period after a Pep application is received, to give potential investors\\na chance to change their minds. Taken together, these rules caught out the\\nBoyces.\\nTheir application was received by Prolific towards the end of February, and\\ntheir units (in the company's High Income and Extra Income unit trusts) were\\nsold on 21st. The money was then held for seven days, before being used to\\nrepurchase units within the Pep.\\nDuring that time, the Boyces were out of the stock market - an unfortunate\\nweek to be in that position, as the market surged. According to figures\\nsupplied by Prolific, this led to a 4.3 per cent rise in the unit price of\\nthe High Income fund and 3.6 per cent for the Extra Income. Buying the units\\nback was therefore a lot more expensive.\\nA close reading of the small print in Prolific's Pep brochure does not make\\nthis market risk altogether clear. It explains the seven-day rule. It does\\nnot explain, though, that existing units will be sold immediately by the\\ncompany, rather than at the end of the cooling-off period, giving rise to\\nthe market risk. Prolific has since told the Boyces that the seven-day rule\\nis no longer required, and that it is reconsidering its policy in this area.\\nAlso, it says it sees nothing wrong with its literature and no reason to\\nchange it. That accounts for part of the Boyces' 'loss'. The rest resulted\\nfrom an aspect of unit-trust pricing that, again, even the most careful\\nreader of the small print might not expect.\\nThe Boyces expected to sell units at Prolific's bid price, and buy them back\\nat the offer price. The loss that resulted from paying the spread between\\nbid and offer prices would largely be recouped by a 4 per cent discount\\noffered by Prolific (3 per cent available to all clients who switch, and 1\\nper cent for taking out a Pep).\\nProlific's Pep brochure gives illustrative figures for what the spread is\\nlikely to be. At the start of this year it was 6 per cent (generally in line\\nwith other unit trusts). The spread could get wider, though: there is a\\nmaximum permitted spread of 8.2 per cent for the High Income unit trust, and\\n7.9 per cent for the Extra Income fund.\\nThe Boyces ended up suffering virtually the biggest spreads permissible  -\\n8.1 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively. Why was the spread so big?\\nBecause, explained Prolific, of a change in the basis of pricing the units\\nduring the week between the sale and repurchase.\\nThere are two different ways of pricing units. The choice of method depends\\non whether a unit-trust manager is selling more units to investors than he\\nis buying back (in which case he is creating new units), or buying back more\\nunits than he is selling (in which case he is cancelling surplus units).\\nIn the first case, a 'creation price' is calculated, to reflect the costs of\\ncreating new units. This is the price at which they are offered to\\ninvestors. In such cases, a unit trust is said to be priced on an offer\\nbasis, and the price moves towards the top end of its permitted range.\\nWhen the manager is a net buyer of units, on the other hand, it calculates a\\n'cancellation' price, to cover the cost of selling the underlying shares. In\\nsuch cases, the unit trust is priced on a bid basis, and the price moves to\\nthe lower end of its range. So the pricing can change a lot, depending on\\nthe manager's situation at any particular time.\\nThe Boyces fell foul of this process. Between the time their units were sold\\nand repurchased, Prolific switched from pricing its units on a bid basis to\\npricing them on an offer basis. That meant that the Boyces sold at the low\\ncancellation price, but had to buy back at the high creation price.\\nIn all, these factors left the Boyces with 1,671 units in the High Income\\ntrust (compared with the 1,793 they started with) and 1,126 in the Extra\\nIncome trust (compared with 1,232). That equates to a capital loss of Pounds\\n247.96 (the pre-loss value of their investment had been Pounds 2,853).\\nIt takes time and and care to build up investments. Such losses can take a\\nlong time to recoup. Given the current rates of income on the Prolific unit\\ntrusts, the switch to the Pep will save Mrs Boyce Pounds 28.63 a year in\\ntax. That means it will be nearly nine years before the tax savings from the\\nPep more than make up for the cost of switching in the first place.\\n'We should have known better,' says a rueful Mr Boyce.\\nHe had always been distrustful of Peps, aware of the high management charge\\nthat can wipe out any tax advantages. But the discount offered by Prolific\\nhelped to persuade him and his wife that the switch was worth the effort. If\\ncareful and well-informed investors can lose a substantial amount from what\\nshould be such a simple transaction, what hope is there for others?\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2996, TEXT: MONEY IS not the only currency,' observes Christopher Lloyd Owen. 'You can\\nbe stinking mega-rich and unhappy.'\\nMr Lloyd Owen is certainly not unhappy. Whether he qualifies as 'stinking\\nmega-rich' is another matter; but life's adventures have left him, at the\\nage of 38, with a seven-bedroom Jacobean house, tucked between the few hills\\nsurrounding Norwich, and a considerable clutch of investments.\\nMore important, he is happily married to his wife, Antonia, and has two\\nchildren - Edward, 10, and Rose, seven. All business decisions are taken\\njointly, he says.\\nBusiness acumen, coupled, as he freely admits, with luck, built the family's\\nprosperity. After school at Winchester and university at the Courtauld\\nInstitute in London, where he was taught by Anthony Blunt, he worked as an\\nart dealer for 10 years, and then built up small businesses, in London and\\nthen in Norfolk.\\nIt is vital to the philosophy guiding Mr Lloyd Owen's personal finances that\\nhe lives his life, and tailors his finances to fit it - never the other way\\naround.\\nBusiness and finance are discussed thoughtfully and incisively, but opinions\\non less dry subjects have a habit of bursting up into the conversation.\\nTopics include his wife, his children, animals, art, particularly bird art,\\ngardening, and shooting. The family home - crammed with prints, paintings,\\nand ornaments - bears testament to his earlier career as an art dealer. Six\\nsofas show that the family has been lucky to receive a number of legacies.\\nThe house - his fourth  - is also the best example of the part luck has\\nplayed in the family's good fortune. He has bought all the four houses he\\nhas ever viewed.\\nAll the moves accidentally took advantage of property price moves. The first\\ntwo homes were in Wandsworth, before the yuppies moved in. Then the family\\nwent to Battersea, just before gentrification had reached that far. In 1986,\\nat last able to move back to Norfolk where he had been brought up, he viewed\\nhis present house, fell in love with it, and bought it with cash. Over the\\nfollowing year, East Anglian property values almost doubled.\\nHe has a Pounds 30,000 mortgage to take advantage of mortgage interest tax\\nrelief, but has otherwise avoided debt to finance property buying.\\nHe scorns speculative property investment, and does not intend to buy a\\nsecond house. 'I would have thought for most people their home would be a\\nsufficient property investment.\\nHis conservative investment philosophy ensures the family's idyllic\\nlifestyle can continue. Mr Lloyd Owen took out a pension when he was 32,\\nwhich is now building 'nicely thank you'. But it was a wrench: 'It's very\\nhard for anyone to realise they are going to be 65. I forced myself to start\\na pension, but every time you pay it out it's dead money.'\\nHe runs the pension fund through his company, for himself, via Standard\\nLife.\\nThis is the family's only collective investment. Unit trusts he considers\\n'dull and grey'. 'Imagine you had Pounds 5,000 to invest and you bought\\nPounds 5,000 in UK equity units from some manager. How dull] Wouldn't it be\\nmore fun to have Pounds 2,500 in BP and Pounds 2,500 in Marks and Spencer?'\\nHe expands: 'If you have a portfolio of UK equities with a reasonable\\nspread, you've done exactly what the unit trusts have done. They have only\\nput several eggs in one basket.\\nHe admits the worth of unit trusts for investing in foreign situations, but\\nresists moves by brokers in this direction.\\n'We hold a reasonably balanced British equity portfolio - haven't the\\nshare-owning classes been owning British equities since the coffee-houses\\nstarted?\\n'Someone once told me the stock market is only the upper class betting shop.\\nAt that time I was rather horrified. But there's a grain of truth in it.\\n'As investors, our balance is almost entirely widows and orphans stocks  -\\nblue chip companies like ICI, Guinness and Glaxo. We were both brought up\\nwith the old-fashioned ideas that you should never sell capital and neither\\na borrower nor a lender be. And we are too busy living life to bother with\\nshort-term gambles and speculations.'\\nTheir portfolio was for many years handled by Grieveson Grant, which joined\\nKleinwort Benson at Big Bang. Mr Lloyd Owen then left Kleinworts for Laing &\\nCruickshank, and now also uses a broker in Norwich.\\nHis reasons are clear and trenchantly expressed - some London brokers are\\nover-charging, and the future for small investors lies with regional\\nstockbrokers: 'I think the London brokers have decided not to give the\\nclient what he wants, because their main fee income comes form corporate\\nwork. The small client is having to pay huge fees for analysts.\\n'The provincial firm, because they don't employ analysts and don't have to\\npay Pounds 120 a square foot, I believe is going to end up as the best\\nstockbroker. I think they will serve the small investors best.\\n'We left Kleinwort Benson when their fee became ridiculous. It was going to\\nbe a third of the income from the portfolio, even if they neither bought nor\\nsold a share.'\\nHe is also 'heavily into Peps'. 'Anyone with a portfolio who doesn't\\nannually move a small amount into a Pep is a fool.' The brokers are\\ninstructed to boost the Lloyd Owens' Peps to their capacity every year.\\nThe only other big investment goes towards schooling. At present, Edward is\\nat prep school in Northamptonshire, and Rose is still at a local village\\nschool. Having made the decision to pursue a private education for their\\nchildren, the Lloyd Owens put a lump-sum into a school-fees capital scheme.\\n'We might have been able to do as well elsewhere, but we've also got a life\\nto lead, and the scheme is going to do it for us. At the beginning of every\\nterm, we will get a handsome cheque. We can't get at the lump sum, but it's\\ndone.'\\nPrudence over life's most weighty concerns means bland practicality never\\nstands in the way of a light impulse, as two delicate, and beautiful African\\nred-eared waxbills in the corner of the Lloyd Owen kitchen could testify. He\\nsaw them while in a pet-shop to buy dog-food, and fell in love with them. He\\nbought a cage at the same time, and carried them home.\\nImpulse buying was off the agenda when he was an art dealer. Dealers, unlike\\nan auctioneers, own their own art.\\nDealing is not for the faint-hearted, particularly if, as in Mr Lloyd Owen's\\ncase, you work on your own account. 'The problem is that, to be a London art\\ndealer, you do not just need weekend money; you need quite major financing\\nif you want to buy really good pictures, which is why quite a lot of London\\nart dealers work for a bank.\\n'It's a very bad investment, art, anyway. You should never buy a picture for\\nan investment. Only buy a picture if you like it. You should only buy a\\npicture as an investment if you are a dealer - then you have a chance to\\nmake a profit out of it. Buying any object for an investment is a gamble.\\n'I stopped because I could no longer afford to buy the pictures I wanted,\\nbecause I had just got married. That was in 1978. It was great fun - I was\\nvery much what you might call a dealer's dealer. I owned shares in pictures\\nand bought from one dealer and sold to another, rather than having private\\ncustomers.'\\nMost dealings on his own account were in English Victorian painters, of whom\\nFrith, best known for 'Derby Day', was an example.\\nMr Lloyd Owen says the experience taught him one thing: 'You have never sold\\na painting until you have got the money. There are a lot of companies out\\nthere supplying goods and having their customers going bust on them. It's\\ngiven me extraordinary caution about giving credit to people. If you work on\\nnormal profit-margins and you do not get paid for 70 days, I would rather\\nnot have the deal.'\\nThis provides a direct line to the core of his current finances, his two\\ncompanies, both of which seem far-removed from the world of high art.\\nOne, Promotion Sourcing Ltd, is owned entirely by the Lloyd Owens. It\\nsupplies companies with promotional gifts, such as golf-balls, diaries or\\nbeer coasters emblazoned with the company logo. 'I went into that in 1983\\nwhen I acquired 50 per cent of the equity. In 1985, I bought my co-partner\\nout of it.'\\nThen came the chance to buy into Hangar Press, a Norwich litho printer which\\nnow shares a building with Promotion Sourcing. 'That's constituted as a\\npartnership. They are different organisations because I have a partner in\\nHangar Press.\\n'We are keen on credit control, and we have minimal borrowings. We don't\\nbleed the business dry. The two companies have a workforce of 11 - and I\\nhave cracking good employees. They are your most important investment, and\\nyour biggest expense. We have great fun at work, and we make money.'\\nChristopher Lloyd Owen is a 'hands-on' businessman, and regards the\\ncompanies as the major financial effort in his family's life: 'They have to\\nbe. And in a way, apart from providing us with an income, they are the only\\nbit of thinking financially that we do about inheritance. Selling out the\\nbusiness could be my pension fund. We are conscious of that.\\n'But if you can have fun on the way ..'\\n'Imagine you had Pounds 5,000 to invest and you bought Pounds 5,000 in UK\\nequity units from some manager,' says Christopher Lloyd Owen 'How dull]\\nWouldn't it be more fun to have Pounds 2,500 in BP and Pounds 2,500 in Marks\\nand Spencer?'

       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-2997, TEXT: IT HAS become something of an old saw that, for unit trusts, 'past\\nperformance is no guide to future prospects'.\\nManagers who specialise in international bonds, however, are only too\\npleased to tell this to clients, because performance in this sector has\\nhistorically been poor, and was particularly bad in 1990. Nevertheless, a\\nnumber of management groups, including Mercury, Barings, Newton and\\nFidelity, launched new global bond unit trusts earlier this year.\\nThe unit-trust international fixed interest sector dropped by an average of\\n6.2 per cent during 1990, according to Micropal. The sector has shown an\\nincrease of only 20.2 per cent over the last five years on Micropal's\\nestimates. Over the last 10 years, it ranks 12th out of 19 sectors.\\nBond trusts also consistently under-perform the market as represented by the\\nJP Morgan Government Bond Index. In the last five years, the index has\\nreturned 24.97 per cent - 4 per cent better than the average bond unit\\ntrust. In the last 12 months, the index has lost only 1.74 per cent,\\nout-performing by almost 5 per cent unit trusts, which are weighed down by\\nmanagement fees.\\nFinancial advisers have retained some hostility towards the trusts, because\\nof the high fees. Alan Torevell, of Torevell Mahon Granville, says that\\nexchange-rate risks have been understated by managers; while Peter Smith, of\\nHill Martin, baulks at the front-end fees - he suggests buying bonds via\\nEuropean banks.\\nHowever, trusts still provide the most practical way for small investors to\\ntap international bonds. This is because several bonds need to be held in\\norder to gain a 'spread' of risk, and deals are usually made in massive\\namounts - for example, French government bonds normally change hands in\\nunits of FFr10m (around Pounds 1m).\\nThe need to hold currency reserves - made considerably less important by the\\nUK's full entry into the European Monetary System - in order to hedge\\nagainst exchange-rate fluctuations also makes it difficult for a private\\ninvestor to get involved.\\nBonds are still not good long-term investments, as the BZW gilt-equity study\\nmakes clear - Pounds 100 invested in gilts in 1918 would now be worth Pounds\\n47.30, while the same amount invested in equities would be priced at Pounds\\n8,039.20.\\nBut the same survey shows the best annual price increases in UK gilts all\\nfollowed the trough of a recession: 1932, when prices rose 35.6 per cent;\\n1977 (30.6 per cent); and 1982 (36.2 per cent).\\nRecessions are traditionally good times to buy bonds. Interest rates are now\\nhigh, and the best time to buy into the bond market is when rates are about\\nto fall. When interest rates are high, investors need a high rate of return,\\nor 'yield', from bonds to tempt them away from other investments. As the\\namount paid out each year is fixed, this can only be done by cutting the\\nprice.\\nWhen interest rates fall, bond prices rise again. This explains recent\\nincreased interest in UK gilts.\\nDavid Rosier, managing director of Mercury Asset Management, put it this\\nway: 'It was exactly this scenario that we had in 1982. Economic activity\\nwas absolutely flat. The gilt-edged market in 1982 returned 52 per cent,\\nwhereas the All-Share index returned about 30 per cent.'\\nNicholas Henderson, head of fixed income at Gartmore, says: 'Where we are\\nnow, with real yields very high, the Anglo-Saxon economies in recession, and\\ninflation falling, we think it's a very attractive environment for the\\nglobal bond investor.' He adds that 1990 was a bad year for bonds, because\\nthe German government issued debt in order to finance reunification, and\\nraised interest rates. So prices fell.\\nThere are strong arguments for investing in foreign government securities,\\nand not UK gilts, thanks to the UK's relatively high rate of inflation.\\nInflation reduces the 'real yield' received by the investor.\\nMr Rosier explains: 'If you look at inflation in this country, it is 9.5 per\\ncent. The yield on gilts is 10.5 or 11 per cent, so you are getting about 1\\nper cent real yield.\\n'French inflation is about 3 per cent, but the yield on French government\\nbonds is about 9 per cent. We think the opportunities for capital gains are\\ngreater in international bonds, because of the real yields available.'\\nPaul Sheehan, manager of Newton Investment Management's fund, puts real\\nyields from French bonds at 9.2 per cent, and from Dutch bonds at 9.3 per\\ncent. He, like most of the other fund managers, will be concentrating on\\nEuropean bonds.\\nHe also notes that, since October, bond prices have already risen by 10 per\\ncent in the US, and by 15 per cent in Japan. European bond prices have yet\\nto start increasing.\\nHambros Bank's model suggests that the optimum time for investing in bonds\\nmay already have passed. This certainly seems to be the case in the\\nAnglo-Saxon economies, while European markets will not offer such good value\\nfor much longer.\\nMr Henderson admits that bonds have never outperformed equities over a\\n10-year period, and does not see this happening in the future. However, he\\ndoes see bonds as an ideal alternative to cash over a medium-term\\nperspective of two or three years, when equities may still be in poor\\nhealth.\\nOver this time-scale, global bonds trusts could provide one of the few\\nroutes to a substantial gain, along with a welcome degree of security.\"},\n",

According to JP Morgan's Government Bond Index Monitor, the\\ngilt-edged market gave investors a total return of 6.65 per cent over the\\nperiod.\\nThis strong performance is not surprising, seen against a background of\\nsharply falling interest rates. The base lending rate stood at 14 per cent\\nat the turn of the year. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer,\\ncurrently faces calls for rates to be cut by a full 1 per cent to 11.5 per\\ncent.\\nHowever, the rise in gilts prices over the quarter was largely concentrated\\nin the first few weeks of the year. For example, the benchmark 10 per cent\\ngilt maturing in 2001 stood at a yield of 10.21 per cent in the first week\\nof January. The price rose steadily during January, such that the yield had\\nfallen to 10.24 per cent by February 15.\\nSince then, however, there has been less pattern to the market, with the\\nyield bouncing back to touch 10.64 per cent by mid-March. There are two main\\nexplanations for the uncertain tone to the market in recent weeks:\\nPolitical uncertainty, with the government seen to be split over the issue\\nof local government finance and in danger of losing an election later this\\nyear. Although the Labour party has won many friends in the City, in general\\nthe gilts market takes the view 'better the devil you know'.\\nSupply pressures, with the market depressed by the prospect of heavy\\nissuance of new government bonds. Mr Lamont predicted a government borrowing\\nrequirement of Pounds 8bn this year, but many in the market expect the\\neventual outcome to be higher. The effect of new issues on the market was\\nseen on April 5, when the Bank of England announced the issue Pounds 800m 9\\nper cent Treasury bonds, maturing 2008. The outstanding bonds fell by nearly\\na point.\\nIn the face of these uncertainties, investors happy to accept currency risk\\nhave looked for value in overseas markets. Many have made currency exposure\\nwork for them.\\nFor example, the performance of the dollar on the foreign exchange markets\\nduring March led to heavy gains for holders of dollar-denominated bonds.\\nOnce the currency gains are taken into account, US government bonds gave\\nsterling-based investors a hefty return of 12.27 per cent over the quarter,\\naccording to figures from Kemper Investment Management. This performance was\\nonly bettered by Canadian, New Zealand and Australian government bond\\nmarkets - each of which gave sterling-based investors a total return of\\naround 16 per cent over the first quarter.\\nHowever, the foreign-exchange markets have recently shown once again that\\nthey can be volatile. This poses a hazard for even the most sophisticated\\ninvestors.\\nFor example, the dollar fell to an all-time low of DM1.45 on February 11.\\nFearing a collapse, many central banks intervened to support it. Just six\\nweeks later, the central bankers were forced to intervene in the opposite\\ndirection, trying to cap the dollar's meteoric rise. By the end of March,\\nthe dollar stood at DM1.70. The movement against sterling was less severe,\\nbut the warning is clear.\\nA less risky method of diversification might be to invest in some of the\\nEuropean government bond markets. After all, sterling can only fluctuate by\\n6 per cent from its central DM2.95 exchange rate against the Deutsche Mark\\nwithin the European exchange rate mechanism.\\nBut this is still enough to alter return on investment profoundly. Thus the\\nrise of sterling, from being the weakest currency in the ERM to the second\\nstrongest (after the Spanish peseta) during March, depressed the returns\\navailable to UK investors from top-performing European bond markets.\\nFor example, French investors saw a total return of 6.45 per cent from their\\nown government bond market during the first quarter. The weakness of the\\nFrench franc, however, meant that UK investors saw a return of just under 4\\nper cent, measured in sterling terms.\"},\n",

Minority shareholders who might\\nwant to hold on to their shares have no choice.\\nThis process has in recent months seen the absorption of Dumez, the\\nconstruction company, into Lyonnaise des Eaux, the water group; or Facom, a\\nmaker of hand-tools, into Strafor, the office furniture group; of Compagnie\\nFrancaise de l'Afrique Occidentale (CFAO), the distribution and African\\ntrading company, into Pinault, the timber group.\\nMore recently, Alcatel Alsthom, the electrical engineering and\\ntelecommunications group, has announced plans to absorb three of its listed\\nsubsidiaries, including Generale Occidentale, formerly the holding company\\nof Sir James Goldsmith. Total, the oil major, plans to do the same with its\\nportfolio holding company Omnium Financier de Paris.\\nParibas, the investment banking group, adopted a different procedure. Rather\\nthan merging, it chose to offer its own shares in exchange for those of\\nPoliet and Ciments Francais, two building material companies which it\\nalready controlled.\\nAlthough this technique leaves minority shareholders with the option of\\nhanging on to their shares, this particular deal caused even greater\\nannoyance, especially among foreign fund managers. After selecting a cement\\nor construction investment for their portfolio, most were furious at being\\noffered an exit into a banking stock.\\nAlthough this wave of mergers and buy-outs has provoked laments in the\\nFrench financial press about the dwindling choice offered to investors on\\nthe Paris stock exchange, however, some investors have viewed it as a\\nhealthy reorganisation of the stock-exchange list. One of the problems with\\nthe Paris market, these commentators remark, is that so many of the\\ncompanies listed on the exchange are controlled by other companies.\\nFrench investors seem not to worry too much about their lack of voting power\\nin a wholly-controlled company ' wrongly, perhaps, in the light of the\\nnumerous occasions in recent years, when minority shareholders have been\\nroyally fleeced by the dominant shareholder ' but at the very least, this\\nstate of affairs reduces the liquidity of the stock.\\nOften, particularly on the second market, the free float of shares is less\\nthan 15 per cent, making it impossible for major investors to deal in any\\nsignificant size.\\nEven among the bigger companies which are not wholly controlled, a formal or\\ninformal pact among the 'hard core' friendly shareholders often reduces the\\nreal free float to 50 per cent or less. Bank of France statistics suggest\\nthat 35 per cent of listed shares in 1989 were owned by individuals, 20 per\\ncent by institutional investors, 21 per cent by industrial and commercial\\ncompanies and 23 per cent by foreigners. But stockbrokers DLP James Capel\\nestimate that 50 per cent of the real float of the shares making up the\\nCAC-40 index are held by foreigners.\\nAmong French investors, the statistics are open to some interpretation. The\\nlatest figures for the number of individual shareowners stand at around 6m,\\nbut these date back to 1988, just after the series of privatisations which\\nbrought a wave of new investors into the equity market for the first time '\\nParibas alone attracted 3.8m small shareholders on its privatisation in\\n1987.\\nMany of these neophyte shareholders have since sold out, or transferred\\ntheir holdings into mutual funds, which account for around 8 per cent of\\nequity investment.\\nFrance's mutual fund industry as a whole is larger than the rest of Europe's\\nput together, with over FFr1,444bn (Pounds 142.80bn) under management at the\\nend of January in Sicavs, or Societes d'Investissement a Capitaux Variables\\n(the main form of mutual fund), according to Europerformance, the specialist\\norganisation which monitors the sector.\\nHowever, the bulk of this money ' FFr1,052bn ' is invested in money-market\\nor bond funds. French equity funds are much weaker, and several French banks\\nhave gone to the UK to look for additional equity fund-management expertise:\\nSociete Generale, the big high-street bank, acquired Touche Remnant, Banque\\nIndosuez, the investment banking arm of the Suez group, bought Gartmore, and\\nCredit Commercial de France, the medium-sized commercial bank, took over\\nFramlington.\\nThe Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB) says the amount of money\\ninvested through Sicavs in French shares plunged in the first nine months of\\nlast year by FFr40bn, to finish up at only FFr102bn at the end of September.\\nOne of the problems is that the government's latest tax-sheltered savings\\nplan, the highly successful Plan d'Epargne Populaire, or Pep, is designed\\nmore to help fixed-interest investment ' unlike its predecessors, the Monory\\nplan or the Delors Compte d'Epargne en Actions, which explicitly set out to\\nboost equity investment. Savers are putting their money either in the Pep,\\nwhich attracted FFr105bn last year, or in short-term money-market Sicavs.\\nThis has not stopped the CAC-40 index from climbing back to a band around\\n1850, but as companies start to call for cash ' such as Beghin-Say with a\\nFFr3bn combined rights and convertible bond issue ' it puts a crimp in the\\nflow of funds into the equity market.

In terms of\\ntotal returns in sterling, the first quarter produced a rise of more than 20\\nper cent.\\nAt around 26,500, the Nikkei still stood well short of its all-time high of\\n38,915, hit in December 1989, but the recovery had been strong enough for\\nmany investors to believe that the market was unlikely to see 20,000 again\\nsoon. The impetus for this year's rise came from the end of the Gulf war,\\nand from a belief that Japanese interest rates were about to fall.\\nStocks began to recover even before the shooting stopped in the Middle East,\\nwhen it was already clear that Iraq could offer little resistance. The\\ndecline in oil prices below Dollars 20 a barrel gave investors in the\\nJapanese market the assurance they needed that Japan's energy lifeline was\\nsecure.\\nMeanwhile, investors began to believe that, after two years of high interest\\nrates, the Bank of Japan would shortly ease the cost of money. Following\\nreductions in US rates, a cut in the Japanese official discount rate, from 6\\nper cent was widely expected before the end of this month, even though Mr\\nYasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, continued to insist that he had no\\nimmediate plan to ease monetary policy.\\nHis main argument was that, despite the squeeze on credit, the economy\\nshowed only slight signs of slowing down. While car sales are falling, as\\nare housing starts, other indicators of economic activity still point up.\\nThe economy, which grew by around 5.2 per cent in the year to March, is\\nexpected by the government to expand by a further 3.8 per cent in 1991-92.\\nLabour shortages remain industry's biggest problem, not any threat of a\\nrecession.\\nInvestors are in two minds about where stocks might go next. The rally in\\nthe first quarter was largely powered by foreign investors, who thought they\\nsaw a chance for Japanese stocks to rise following surges in New York and\\nLondon. After the foreign buyers, Japanese individuals jumped into the\\nmarket.\\nBut Japanese financial institutions remained rather cautious. Partly, this\\nis because they have less money than before to invest in stocks. Banks need\\nto maintain loans to industry, just as they need to control their assets\\ncarefully to keep inside international guidelines on the ratio between\\nassets and capital. Insurance companies are expanding loans to industry just\\nas the net flow of funds from clients is diminishing. Investment-trust\\ncompanies are also seeing their customers leave for the safety of bank\\ndeposits. Pension funds alone cannot take up the slack.\\nHigh interest rates are no friend to stocks, particularly in Japan where\\ndividend yields are very low and investors rely almost exclusively on\\ncapital gains from their equity investments. Nevertheless, the resilience of\\nthe Japanese economy, even during a world economic slow-down, means that\\nsooner or later some companies will generate profits increases large enough\\nto justify substantial re-rating of their stock. Despite pressure of rising\\nlabour and other costs, this may not be too far away. However, stockbrokers\\nwarn that not all companies will benefit from such gains.\\nMeanwhile, other stock markets in Asia and the Pacific also mostly ended the\\nquarter with considerable increases.\\nThe easing of US interest rates inspired a general re-rating of markets in\\nthe region. In February alone, stocks rose 25 per cent in Taiwan, and 30 per\\ncent in the Philippines. Rallies in Australia and Singapore were more\\nmodest.\\nHowever, in all the region, including Japan, only in Hong Kong do stocks\\nstand well above their levels of a year ago.

The strength of the US currency boosted prospects for the big\\ndollar-earners which provide about a quarter of the aggregate earnings of\\nthe Footsie list. At the same time, sterling's improvement within the ERM\\ncurrency table enhanced the opportunities for cutting UK base rates.\\nBase rates were cut three times during the quarter, to bring UK rates down\\nto 12.5 per cent by the end of March, with the equity market clamouring for\\nfurther cuts. The half-point cut in base rates just after Budget day\\novershadowed the Budget itself, which was seen as neutral for the stock\\nmarket.\\nAll equity sectors achieved positive returns over the period. But lower base\\nrates failed to inspire property shares, which underperformed the All-Share\\nby 9.9 per cent. Weakest of all were oil shares, which underperformed the\\nAll-Share by 10.4 per cent - not, strangely, because of the Gulf conflict,\\nbut rather because of negative views on crude-oil prices.\\nThe successes ranged across the dollar-earning stocks, with Glaxo, Hanson,\\nBAT Industries, RTZ and Reuters Holdings prominent, to sectors recovering\\nfrom previous misfortune, such as engineering, textile and even contracting\\nand construction stocks.\\nAs the market moved into the second quarter of 1991, some murmurs of\\nuncertainty could be heard in the City of London.

'We just can't afford all these\\noverheads.'\\nBusiness, largely from the public housing and office-building sectors, had\\nflooded into their practice for eight years, until last summer when the\\nimpact of high interest rates caused a significant drop in worthwhile\\nenquiries. Since then, the staff have been kept busy, finishing off current\\nprojects. Now, the facts have to be faced: that there isn't any more, or any\\nlikelihood of any more, work on the horizon.\\n'Yep, something's got to give,' agrees Amanda, sadly pouring herself another\\nglass of wine.\\nJohn casts a wistful glance out of the window at his brand-new\\ntop-of-the-range car parked outside the garage, gleaming with prestige and\\nbursting with executive gadgets. Through the other window, he can see his\\npartners' cars, parked in the street and looking equally appealing and\\nequally expensive. He heaves a sigh. 'Right, let's get down to it.'\\nMr Ledger, the company accountant, has studied the books, talked to each of\\nthe partners and written a massive plan of action, to try to save the\\npractice. He has pointed out that, as a partnership, the three architects\\nhave unlimited liability against partnership debts.\\n'If the problem gets any worse, your houses could be at risk,' he has told\\nthem. 'If you make severe cutbacks now, while you still can, you might be\\nable to salvage enough of a business to have something left when the good\\ntimes come around again.'\\nThe Budget, largely aimed at helping companies with difficulties such as\\ntheirs, has in fact little real help to offer the partnership. However, Mr\\nLedger has recommended that the partners switch to paying VAT on a cash\\nbasis, in response to the campaign the Customs & Excise department has\\nstarted: 'Even with current problems, your income is over the Pounds 35,000\\nthreshold but well under the Pounds 300,000 limit for cash accounting,' says\\nMr Ledger. 'Switching to only paying VAT when you actually receive payment\\nwill give you a massive cash-flow injection which is something you really\\nneed at the moment.'\\nThe first cutback is that the remaining staff - who, apart from the three\\npartners, amount to Dawn, the office manager, and an architectural student\\ngaining practical experience - are to be made redundant.\\n'You'll have to manage any work that comes in on your own,' says Mr Ledger,\\n'even typing the letters. The staff have been with the practice for less\\nthan two years, and so are not entitled to redundancy money. They have been\\npaid on a PAYE basis, and over the past three months payment of their tax\\nhas fallen into arrears.\\n'Keep it that way,' recommends the redoubtable Mr Ledger. 'There's no\\ninterest on PAYE arrears, and you have your own tax bills coming up. If you\\ngo into arrears on those, you will pay interest.'\\nThe thought of the July approach of tax bills has sobered up the threesome\\neven further. Self-employed people pay their tax on a year-before basis. The\\ntax bill that arrives in July will reflect earnings for the year 1989-90 - a\\nyear that John, Tom and Amanda remember, now rather ruefully, as a\\nhigh-income year.\\nThe partners have stopped paying themselves salaries, and their payments\\ninto pension plans and private medical insurance schemes have been suspended\\n -dismissed as luxuries by Mr Ledger. The accountant has also recommended\\nthat the partners chop up their company credit-cards, and as each wields the\\nkitchen scissors the gloom deepens.\\nThe partnership's offices are the next to receive the attention of Mr\\nLedger. The office rent has fallen into arrears - a step that Mr Ledger\\napproves of: 'Hold fire on the rent,' he stoutly advises. 'You need the cash\\ntoo much. Advertise to sub-let your spare office space. A large empty office\\nhas bad vibes for creative people.'\\nBut poor John, Tom and Amanda don't feel very creative. John has been in\\ntouch with the Royal Institute of British Architects, to see what help they\\ncan offer. The RIBA's London region redundancy counselling service has\\nproved to be extremely busy at the moment - which John finds comforting, in\\na gloomy sort of way - and the advice offered has proved upbeat and\\npositive:\\n'The RIBA has told me that part of the strategy for surviving the recession\\nat the moment is to be well-placed to take advantage of the up-swing,' he\\nsays. 'They recommend taking a long and honest look at the practice,\\nanalysing strengths, weaknesses, resources and staff expertise.'\\nThe partners look at each other with some amusement, hunting for signs of\\nexpertise, but the atmosphere does cheer up a little as they each decide to\\ntake a new area in which to research new business opportunities.\\nJohn fancies himself as a 1990s Green person, and so volunteers to research\\ndevelopments in energy-saving and environmentally-sound work. Tom has been\\nthe housing king in his time, and is looking towards bombarding the Housing\\nCorporation, which remains a great unknown at present but might have funding\\nfree next year, with quantities of material on the merits of using their\\npractice over all others.\\nAmanda, looking towards 1992, has decided to look into developing\\nopportunities for undertaking work in France, in partnership with a French\\narchitectural firm that has plenty of work at the moment.\\nThe three partners hope that from this evening's session they will emerge\\nleaner, fitter and ready to take on any improvement in the construction\\nsector. 'We'll certainly be leaner and fitter, whatever happens,' says Tom,\\nsweeping the credit-card pieces into the bin, reflecting dolefully on his\\nlost access to lost lunches.\\nLater that night, the Plowshares - Alison, John and Toby  - gather around\\nthe kitchen table to discuss the matter. Toby casts a sideways look at his\\nharassed father, and asks with apparent innocence: 'What are you going to do\\nabout the cars? I don't suppose you can afford those any more.'\\n'We didn't talk about the cars, actually,' John replies, through gritted\\nteeth.\\nThe cars, most beloved of the company toys that the partners have invested\\nin, should go, on the advice of Mr Ledger. 'The leases are too new to have\\nany value, but you would be wise to get rid of them and downgrade your cars\\nto something cheaper, particularly now that the Budget has increased the tax\\nburden for company cars,' says Mr Ledger. 'It's a short-term move, but it\\nwould really help cash-flow. And, with the new tax, get rid of these mobile\\nphones if you really want to save money.'\\nBanished to using a phone box and driving a Mini, John grows philosophical.\\nThat night, before turning out the kitchen light, John takes one last look\\nat his car parked outside the house. 'Ah well,' he reflects, 'no\\ncentral-locking, winding up the windows. . . It'll be good exercise for me,\\nat least.'\\nHelp in compiling this feature, in which all the characters are imaginary,\\nwas provided by the RlBA London Region and Michael Sampson, of accountants\\nSampson West.\"},\n",

Competition between banks and building societies\\nin the Tessa market is particularly keen, and they are reluctant to risk\\nlosing customers by lowering the interest rate.\\nFor savers who want to lock into a high interest rate, there are a few banks\\noffering fixed-rate Tessas.\\nConfederation Bank (tel 0438 744-238) has a five-year fixed-rate Tessa with\\na gross compound annual rate (CAR) of 11.25 per cent. You have to invest a\\nlump sum of Pounds 8,040 and, each year, the appropriate sum is switched\\ninto the Tessa from a feeder account. The rate on the feeder account is also\\nfixed at 11.25 per cent, but remember that interest on feeder accounts is\\nliable to income tax if you are a taxpayer. The penalty for transfer or\\nclosure is 180 days' interest.\\nNational Mortgage Bank (tel 021 712-2800) recently launched a five-year\\nfixed-rate Tessa, which pays 11 per cent gross CAR. Again, you make your\\ndeposit into a fixed-rate feeder account, but in this case, the minimum\\ninvestment is Pounds 5,000. There is a penalty of 180 days' interest for\\ntransfer or early closure.\\nIf you are worried about locking into a fixed rate for five years, Save &\\nProsper/Robert Fleming (tel 0800 282-101) have a one-year fixed-rate Tessa.\\nThe rate is fixed at 10.25 per cent gross CAR, and after one year you can\\nchoose to switch your money into S & P's variable-rate Tessa or you can opt\\nfor another year at the fixed rate - though bear in mind that the new fixed\\nrate could be much lower if the base rate has been cut substantially. The\\nminimum investment is Pounds 500, and the maximum is Pounds 3,000 in the\\nfirst year. Interest is credited monthly, and you can withdraw net interest\\nquarterly if you want. There is a discretionary Pounds 50 penalty for\\ntransfer or closure.\\nBear in mind, too, that S & P's fixed rate of 10.25 per cent is well below\\nthe 12.18 per cent gross CAR being offered on its variable rate Tessa, and\\nthat many variable-rate Tessas on the market are offering 15 per cent or\\nmore. No one is giving any clues as to whether they will be lowering their\\nrates in the near future, so it is rather a gamble. However, if you do\\ndecide to plump for a variable-rate Tessa, you would be wise to choose one\\nwith no transfer penalties, as this will allow you to move your money into\\nthe most competitive Tessa at short notice.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-3008, TEXT: OUR PARENTS probably told us to stay out of debt if we possibly could. Good\\nadvice, in the main. However, one kind of debt may be worth clinging to -\\nthe mortgage.\\nMany people realise this, as is shown by a survey conducted by Mori for\\nScottish Amicable, the life insurance group. Asked how they would use a\\nPounds 30,000 windfall, 42 per cent of respondents said none of it would go\\ntowards repaying their mortgage. Only 13 per cent said all of it would.\\nThe proportion who would repay rose with the size of the mortgage. Only 31\\nper cent of those with a Pounds 40,000 mortgage said they would not break\\ninto their windfall to repay any of the loan, while 28 per cent said it\\nwould all be used to reduce the debt. This suggests that people are well\\ninformed about mortgages. On loans up to Pounds 30,000, tax relief on the\\ninterest makes them very cheap debts - despite the Budget - but the net\\ninterest rates paid on larger loans are worth avoiding. This is shown by\\ncomparing the real rate of interest paid on a home loan, after mortgage\\ninterest tax relief, with the rates of interest available elsewhere.\\nOn the first Pounds 30,000 of a mortgage, the net interest rate after\\nmortgage-interest tax relief, is currently 10.31 per cent, according to the\\nBuilding Societies Association. This will become better value if interest\\nrates continue to fall.\\nIf any kind of debt makes you lie awake at night, then it is probably best\\nto pay off the mortgage as soon as you have the cash to do so. However, some\\npeople, including mortgage-lenders themselves, argue that this approach is\\nunnecessarily prudent, because you should be able to find a safe alternative\\ninvestment that offers a higher rate of interest than you pay on your\\nmortgage - for example, tax-exempt special saver accounts (Tessas),\\nindex-linked gilts or national saving certificates.\\nSteven Berry, of Hill Martin, points out that the new regime of independent\\ntaxation and the abolition of composite rate tax on building-society\\naccounts for non-taxpayers, have made this easier - a non-tax-paying spouse\\ncan receive some interest gross, while paying off debt net of tax.\\nBy investing in this way a sum that might otherwise be used to reduce a\\nmortgage, you still have the cash in hand. For as long as you have a\\nmortgage, your building society is available to help with loans for\\nhome-improvements or repairs.\\nJohn Bridel, adviser with Towry Law, adds: 'Very often one should keep the\\nfunding vehicle going, anyway.' He points out that you should not\\nnecessarily repay endowment-linked mortgages in full, as you will lose the\\nterminal bonus of the life insurance policy linked to the mortgage.\\nThe money put towards the life policy makes up a relatively small percentage\\nof the total monthly payments, points out Mr Bridel; but the balance of the\\nfinal maturity value, after you have paid off the loan, could be very useful\\n -for instance, to invest for retirement income. The terminal bonus, which\\ncould be lost, makes up much of the return from with-profits policies.\\nSometimes, too, one is required to pay an exit-fee when clearing a mortgage.\\nIf you decide to pay off without notice, some lenders may charge a maximum\\nof an extra three months' interest on redemption. The Building Societies\\nAssociation says this would almost certainly be waived in most cases, and\\nthe big societies do not make the charge, but it is as well to check the\\nsmall print in your contract. Check, too, on fixed-interest mortgages. The\\nspecial arrangements that the lender has made in order to offer a fixed rate\\nwill be thrown awry by early repayment; and a justifiable fee of around\\nPounds 100 will normally be payable.\\nYou pay the full gross rate on all of the mortgage that is outstanding above\\nthe Pounds 30,000 limit for mortgage tax relief. Last year, gross mortgage\\nrates managed to exceed 15 per cent. You are unlikely to find another\\ninvestment that can guarantee to match this return - though Tessa rates\\nappear to be remainining high while mortgage rates come down - so the best\\nbet is to use any lump sum to pay off any of your mortgage in excess of\\nPounds 30,000.\\nThe abolition of top-rate mortgage tax relief has made mortgages\\nsignificantly less good value for the very well off, and tax relief must be\\nsubject to continued political risk. Successive governments have allowed the\\nthreshold of Pounds 30,000 to be eaten away by inflation - if it had been\\nindexed from its rate in 1974, the threshold would now be almost Pounds\\n120,000, according to Hill Martin - and it might be cut completely by a\\nLabour government. The Conservatives intend to cut basic-tax rates, which\\nwould reduce the amount of relief.\\nAll such changes shift the logic in favour of repaying more of the mortgage.\\nBut it is worth timing the move carefully if you have a building-society\\nrepayment mortgage, because the societies charge interest on the capital\\noutstanding at the beginning of their year, and then collect it over the 12\\nmonths. On this basis, you should make your repayment towards the end of the\\nbuilding society year - most societies have a December 31 year-end.\\nIf you are repaying a part of the loan on which you are receiving tax\\nrelief, you should let your tax inspector know as soon as possible, says Mr\\nBridel. Otherwise you could find yourself with a big tax bill at the end of\\nthe year.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-3009, TEXT: HOMEOWNERS OUGHT logically to expect to pay considerably more for their\\nhouse buildings insurance this year. The storms of January 1990 - one of the\\nworst insured losses ever in the UK - were followed during the year by\\nrecord subsidence losses of nearly Pounds 1bn.\\nOne might have expected all that to translate into a pretty sizeable\\nincrease in premiums - especially in the context of more general climactic\\ntrends, which are making insurers view the UK as something of a catastrophe\\nzone.\\nHowever, the picture is a more complex than it seems. For one thing,\\ncompetition within the insurance industry is hotting up. The few big UK\\ncompanies that once dominated the British market no longer have such a tight\\ngrip; while the liberalisation of the European insurance market is leading\\nFrench, Swiss, German and other companies to compete in the UK.\\nThe competition has led a number of insurers to seek ways to reduce the cost\\nof distributing insurance. In particular, a number have begun direct-sales -\\ncombining newspaper, television and radio advertising with sales over the\\ntelephone - in order to cut out the middleman.\\nMost British householders buy their house building insurance through their\\nbuilding society, paying a commission of about 30 per cent for the\\nprivilege. High-street insurance brokers also charge commission which, while\\nit is less than that charged by the building societies, can still amount to\\nbetween 15 per cent and 25 per cent of the bill.\\nIn contrast, direct-sales companies can distribute their policies more\\ncheaply (with the cost of advertising and telephone back-up generally less\\nthan the commission) and offer lower premiums.\\nNew entrants to the market, like Royal Bank of Scotland (Direct Line) and\\nthe Swiss company Wintertur (Churchill), are among the pioneers of\\ndirect-sales methods; but other companies, such as Royal Insurance and\\nGeneral Accident, which already have a sizeable share of building-society\\nbusiness, have set up direct-sales operations.\\nAt the same time, insurers are beginning to differentiate between risks,\\ncharging rates that vary according to the age and building style of a\\nproperty. They have charged different rates for house contents, according to\\nlocation, for several years; this year, at least two have announced that\\nthey are also considering varying buildings rates according to location.\\nThe reason for this is that properties built on the clay soils of south-east\\nEngland, especially those with the shallower foundations typical before\\n1945, are more vulnerable to damage by subsidence. A number of buildings in\\ncoastal or river-valley locations are more susceptible to flood, and\\nhomeowners in such localities can also expect to pay more.\\nWith greater competition, companies are concerned to meet claims quickly,\\nand are offering sophisticated back-up services. A number now offer all\\npolicyholders the use of telephone help-lines.\\nFor example, General Accident's policyholders have free access to the\\ncompany's advice-lines, which give customers advice on dealing with all\\npractical elements of a claim, including access to a recommended list of\\nlocal plumbers, electricians and other services. Royal Insurance offers a\\nsimilar service: the company's 'gold' policy provides a combined\\nhouse-buildings and contents insurance, with legal-expenses insurance, as\\nwell as 24-hour access to a help-line.\\nAs far as pricing is concerned, the position is clearest with buildings\\ninsurance. The leading insurers that sell through building societies (Royal\\nand Sun Alliance, for example) increased their premium rates to 2.20p per\\nPounds 1,000 of cover following a 10 per cent rate increase at the end of\\nlast year.\\nThe increases will widen the disparity between these rates and those charged\\nby over two dozen other companies. The direct writers obviously are among\\nthem. Direct Line offers a rate of Pounds 1.60, for example. But there are\\nalso a number of companies that sell either through brokers or their own\\nagents: they include Zurich Insurance and Co-operative Insurance Society.\\nZurich sells its products through independent brokers, offers a rate of\\nPounds 1.40 per Pounds 1,000 of cover for properties built after 1919, and\\nPounds 1.70 for properties built between 1850 and 1919 (although this is\\nonly available to customers living in areas safe from flooding or\\nsubsidence).\\nCo-operative Insurance Society, the Manchester-based insurer, recently\\nreduced its rates to Pounds 1.60 for homeowners insuring homes built after\\n1945, and Pounds 1.80 for homes built before that date. Zurich says its\\npolicies are cheaper than those offered by the major companies, because it\\nsells through independent brokers.\\nThe new direct-line underwriters also offer cheaper home buildings policies.\\nUnderwriters at Lloyd's of London offer a basic rate of Pounds 1.75, but\\nsubstantially less than this in some cases. High-value properties can win\\ncheaper rates, for example. Rates of Pounds 1.50 per Pounds 1,000 are not\\nuncommon for houses worth Pounds 250,000 or more, and for a house worth more\\nthan Pounds 1m a rate of Pounds 1.25 is available.\"},\n",

It has two aims: one, to ameliorate the\\nplight of homeless in the capital and; two, to guarantee a 40 per cent\\nreturn on investments.\\nThe scheme is run in conjunction with the Peabody Trust, a registered\\ncharity, founded in 1862. House the Homeless will buy vacant properties on a\\nleasehold basis, letting them to the homeless. At the end of five years, the\\nPeabody Trust guarantees to buy the properties at 140 per cent of the asking\\nprice. The risks?

A sobering\\nthought, with a general election due next year, if not this.\\nThe biggest Budget boost for the savings industry was aimed at friendly\\nsocieties - and children, says Mark Rittner, of financial advisers Rathbone\\nBrothers. In other investments, 'if a parent makes a gift to a child, the\\nincome on that gift is attributed to the parent and taxable. In friendly\\nsocieties, however, the income is solely attributed to the child and\\ntax-free,' says Mr Rittner.\\nThis year, the chancellor raised the annual tax-free investment level in\\nfriendly societies from Pounds 150 to Pounds 200, and revived the right to\\nissue children's life policies on a tax-exempt basis. The government imposed\\na quota restriction on life policies for children in 1985, the effect of\\nwhich was to stop many friendly societies from issuing them.\\n'We are particularly thrilled,' said Peter Gray, general manager of\\nTunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society. 'And we are definitely bringing\\nback a Baby Bond (a bond written on the life of the child, which can be\\nredeemed at a certain age or continued indefinitely).' Tunbridge Wells\\nEquitable offers two types of baby bond - a traditional with-profits policy,\\nand a unit-linked one based almost exclusively in equities.\\nClive Scott-Hopkins, of independent advisers Towry Law, recommends Tunbridge\\nWells's with profits contract: 'It's very competitive and has been one of\\nthe top 10 performers for years.'\\nWhile providing a nest-egg for children is a good idea, and the\\nfriendly-society route a relatively affordable one, parents would do well\\nalso to plan for education. The average annual fees for independent boarding\\nschools in 1990 was Pounds 6,000, according to statistics from the\\nIndependent Schools Information Service. For independent day schools, the\\nfigure stood at Pounds 3,300.\\nEducational trusts are a route to be recommended only if you are sure the\\nmoney will be used for school fees, and as long as they retain their\\ncharitable status. These conditions met, then Save and Prosper and the\\nSchool Fees Insurance Agency have unusual features in their schemes. A\\nlump-sum buys an annuity to provide termly payments. Although the yields on\\nthis investment are relatively low, income tax, which is usually deducted\\nfrom the taxable element of the annuity payments, can be reclaimed.\\nParents wishing to provide for their children's future would also be well\\nadvised to examine ways of minimising inheritance tax. M & G's Estate\\nProtection Plan - a life policy written under trust  - was named the winner\\nof the Financial Adviser's product of the year award for its user-friendly\\nand flexible approach.

So now may be the time\\nto look more critically at interest-bearing current accounts.\\nInterest paid on balances in credit has fallen in quite a striking fashion.\\nIn July last year, Abbey National paid 6.25 per cent gross on all balances\\nin credit.

Some of the large clearers do fairly well, too: Barclays\\nand NatWest have held their authorised rates unchanged.

'This means that the current\\ngeneration of fixed mortgages is close to being as low as they are likely to\\nget.'\\nMortgage brokers report that fixed-rate and capped-rate mortgages make up\\nmost of the business they are doing at the moment. Bargain offers go fast\\nwhen they appear on the market. A mortgage from Portman Building Society,\\nwith interest of 11 per cent fixed for two years, was sold out in five days\\nthis spring.\\nMore typical is a three-year fixed-rate mortgage at 11.75 per cent (APR\\n12.59 per cent) from Scarborough Building Society, available until the end\\nof April or a two- or three-year fix at 11.45 per cent from Girobank.\\nThe sort of mortgage to look out for in the months ahead is one with an\\ninterest rate of 11 per cent or less for an extended period, three to five\\nyears. They may not compare very favourably with the sort of mortgages on\\noffer in the spring of 1988, but they are probably all that can reasonably\\nbe expected from the UK market in the foreseeable future.\\nIf you contemplate switching to a fixed mortgage, ask what the annual\\npercentage rate is - on the Girobank mortgage quoted above it was 14.6 per\\ncent, for example. Also enquire what hidden or additional charges there may\\nbe; and whether there are substantial early-redemption penalties if you\\nrepay the mortgage early.\\nMost reputable lenders will not make you pay redemption penalties if you\\nstay with them when moving house and getting a new mortgage. But some have\\nbeen making good money in a difficult market over the last few years by\\nstinging their other customers for early-redemption penalties averaging\\naround three months interest.\\nThe justification for this is that lenders are committed to funding at a\\npre-agreed price for the life of a fixed-rate mortgage, and that if the\\ncustomer redeems early because interest rates have fallen, the lender may be\\nleft with expensive funds on its hands.\\nThis month John Charcol, the mortgage brokers, put a two-year fixed-rate\\nmortgage on the market at 11.75 per cent (12.6 APR) which is especially\\nflexible: not only can it be a repayment or an interest-only mortgage, as\\nwell as one of the endowment variety, but it has no redemption penalties,\\nthough there is a Pounds 195 administration charge on completion of the\\nmortgage. Ian Darby, John Charcol's managing director, points out that 11.75\\nper cent is well below the average mortgage interest rate of the last 10\\nyears.\\nSome home-buyers will hold on until election time - when we may expect base\\nrates to fall.

The societies offer products that are easy to understand;\\nthey are accessible; they offer a guarantee of capital return; and they are\\nuniversally perceived as safe.\\nBut if you expect to need income from your investments over a long period,\\nbuilding societies are a dangerous home for your savings. They provide no\\nprotection from that great enemy of investors - inflation. A retired widow,\\nnow with the state pension and a small pension from her late husband's\\nemployers, may feel reasonably well off with savings of Pounds 50,000: she\\ncould earn a gross income of as much as Pounds 7,000.\\nBut in 15 years, inflation compounded at 5 per cent annually would halve the\\nreal value of her building-society deposit. If interest rates also fell,\\nthen the same sum might provide an income of only Pounds 5,000 - worth just\\nPounds 2,500 in today's prices.\\nTo avoid the rigours of inflation, you have normally to sacrifice income\\nnow, in order to achieve capital growth, and thus, the prospect of a higher\\nincome in future.\\nThe sure way to protect yourself against inflation is to buy index-linked\\ngilts or national savings certificates. But in the former case, the\\nimmediate income is only 2 per cent gross, and the latter pay no income at\\nall. So if you do need to live off the income from your investments, only a\\nsmall proportion of your portfolio can be placed in either of these\\nvehicles.\\nEquities have proved, over the long term, to be one of the best hedges\\nagainst inflation; but, as James Higgins, of London-based fee-charging\\nadvisers Chamberlain de Broe, says: 'Not everyone can afford to wait until\\nthe yield on the average unit trust grows sufficiently so that it provides a\\nreasonable income.'\\nMr Higgins has designed a scheme that will yield a high immediate income,\\nbut which also permits the investor to share in the fortunes of investment\\nvehicles that are better longer-term achievers.\\n'Up to one third of the available sum is used to purchase a five-year\\ntemporary annuity, taking advantage of the high rates we presently enjoy,'\\nhe says. 'The balancing two-thirds will make up a five-year growth\\nportfolio, utilising whatever allowances the investor has available, but\\nincluding Tessas, personal equity plans (Peps), National Savings,\\nzero-coupon investment trusts - and perhaps even an element of\\nassured-tenancy Business Expansion Scheme, if the client's circumstances are\\nappropriate.'\\nThe temporary annuity pays a very high rate, although of course it is only\\nreturning to the investor his own capital. But that means, as a consequence,\\nthat the investor will pay little income tax.\\nBy the time the annuity expires, Mr Higgins argues, the growth portfolio\\nwill have replaced the loss of the annuity capital and achieved some extra\\ngain on top.\\nHowever, there are many ways to achieve income from investments. The most\\ncommon are described below. The golden rule, as with any other form of\\ninvestment, is to spread your risk. Do not rely entirely on anything,\\nwhether it is a fixed-income or an equities-based instrument.\\nHigh-yielding unit trusts offer capital growth, too\\nUNIT TRUSTS may not seem the most obvious source of investment income,\\nbecause yields, currently around 6 per cent gross, compare badly with the\\nreturns from building societies.\\nThe key, of course, is the fact that income on an equity-based investment\\ncan grow. Figures from Fund Research show that dividends in the equity\\nincome sector grew by 111 per cent between 1985 and 1990, compared with an\\n89 per cent rise in the income offered by the FT-A All-Share Index over the\\nsame period.\\nDividends are normally paid twice a year, and a judicious selection of funds\\nwith different payment dates can ensure that some kind of dividend cheque\\narrives every month. There are around 130 unit trusts in the UK equity\\nincome sector.\\nAt the same time, the capital value of the investment will grow over the\\nlong term - something that will not happen with a building society deposit.\\nThe average UK equity income unit trust grew by 440.8 per cent in the 10\\nyears to March 1, according to Finstat, although that figure does include\\nreinvested income. In capital terms, the increase has been somewhere around\\n250 to 300 per cent.\\nThe risk, of course, is that in much shorter periods, the value of the trust\\ncould go down. So high-yielding unit trusts should never make up all the\\nincome-seeking investor's portfolio.\\nGuaranteed income bonds carry a tax snag\\nGUARANTEED income bonds tend to be issued by insurance companies, and offer\\na fixed return over a set period of years, normally somewhere between one\\nand five. Rates vary, depending on the life of the bond and the amount being\\ninvested, but at the time of writing were between 9.5 and 10 per cent.\\nThe return that GIBs pay is net of basic-rate tax, which cannot be\\nreclaimed, so they are not suitable for non-taxpayers. The best time to buy\\nthem is when interest rates are at their peak, so that investors can lock in\\nto the high rates on offer.\\nMany companies offering bonds are quite small - but investors are protected\\nin case of failure by the Policyholders Protection Act, which guarantees to\\npay out 90 per cent of the first Pounds 100,000 invested.\\nNo CGT on gilts - and the issuer won't go bust\\nGILTS, which are bonds issued by the UK government, are an obvious choice\\nfor any income investor's portfolio. They provide a healthy yield - between\\n10 and 11 per cent at the time of writing  - and any profit is free of\\ncapital gains tax. In addition, the issuer will never go bust.\\nThere are two yields normally quoted for gilts. The running yield,\\ncalculated by dividing the trading price by the interest rate or coupon, is\\nthe best indicator of the short-term return you will receive. The gross\\nredemption yield takes account of the fact that gilts will eventually be\\nrepaid (redeemed) so investors will make a capital gain or loss, depending\\non whether the bond is trading above or below the offer price. This is\\nimportant if you intend to hold the bond until redemption.\\nGilts have different repayment dates, and there are some issues that will\\nnever be repaid at all. Buying a long-dated issue brings certainty of return\\nover a long period; but it also means the investor is highly prey to that\\ngreat enemy of gilts - inflation. Long-dated gilt prices can also vary\\nsubstantially, so there is a risk that the value of your holding can go down\\nin the short term.\\nThe cheapest way of buying gilts is through the National Savings Stock\\nRegister, via the local post office. You can also buy a gilt or bond unit\\ntrust, which will attempt to provide you with a good income by managing a\\nportfolio of securities.\\nYou can take the interest from your Tessa account\\nALTHOUGH tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) are desined to be held\\nfor five years, it is possible to use them to provide income.\\nInvestors can withdraw interest from the account without penalty, although\\nthey can only receive the net (after-tax) rate. However, the tax advantages\\ndo not disappear. At the end of the five-year period, the investor will\\nreceive the 'tax' element of his interest in the form of a bonus.\\nIf you plan to hold a large sum of money in the building society anyway,\\nthere is no harm in holding as large as possible a proportion of it (Pounds\\n3,000 in the first year, Pounds 9,000 over five years in a Tessa). Your\\nincome will be the same, and you will qualify for a tax bonus on top.\\nAnnuities offer most to long-livers and over-70s\\nAN ANNUITY is an odd sort of investment, in that it is really a gamble on\\nhow long you will live. You invest a lump-sum, and an insurance company\\nguarantees to pay you an income for the rest of your life. But when you die,\\nthe insurance company, in most cases, keeps your investment.\\nThus the longer you live, the better you do. Insurance companies know this,\\nso they vary the rates they are prepared to guarantee, depending on the life\\nof the buyer. The older you are, the greater the income the annuity will\\npay. For these reasons, the Consumers' Association argues that it is\\nprobably only worth considering buying an annuity if you are over 70. (There\\nare also joint-life annuities which carry on paying out until both husband\\nand wife are dead).\\nThe most common type of annuity gives a fixed income, which obviously leaves\\nthe investor at risk from inflation. But it is possible to buy an\\nincreasing, or even an index-linked annuity, where the income steadily\\nrises, though it starts from a lower base. Unit-linked annuities give a\\nreturn based on the value of a particular fund, and thus can vary in value.\\nThere are also temporary annuities, which have a limited lifespan and pay a\\nhigh income - but you lose all your capital when the annuity expires.\\nA lot of people are forced into buying annuities as part of their pension\\nplan. If you fall into this category, then it may well be sensible to\\ndiversify the rest of your portfolio by buying more flexible\\nincome-producing instruments. However, see above for the use of temporary\\nannuities, as part of an overall portfolio.\\nCash funds for high yields and low charges\\nCASH unit trusts invest in money-market instruments - deposits, Treasury\\nbills, commercial paper and the like - with the aim of offering unitholders\\na high yield.\\nA number of such trusts have been established over the past couple of years.\\nInvestors had been discouraged by the poor performance of equities, and this\\ncreated an incentive for fund-management companies to offer a product that\\nwas certain not to go down in price.\\nThe managers also realised that, by persuading investors to switch into the\\ncash fund during a bear market, they would keep funds within the group,\\nrather than lose them altogether.\\nThe trusts usually have a nil, or very low, upfront charge and a high yield.\\nAt the time of writing, Fidelity's cash unit trust was offering a yield of\\n13.7 per cent, assuming income reinvested.\\nEquities in a Pep mean tax-free dividends\\nEQUITIES are a time-honoured means of achieving a growing income. They\\nrepresent a risk - the capital value of the shares can fall and dividends\\ncan be cut, as many investors have been reminded in recent months. In the\\nlong term, however, a diversified portfolio of shares is one of the best\\nways to ensure your income keeps pace with inflation.\\nAnd if you are going to own shares for a long period, there is a strong\\nargument for holding them in a personal equity plan. For a 40 per cent\\ntaxpayer, the fact that dividend income in a Pep is tax-free is highly\\nattractive.\\nIn the short term, the fees charged by the plan manager may outweigh the tax\\nbenefits. But over the long term, say five years or more, the income tax\\nadvantages are substantial - there is much to be said for holding\\nhigh-yielding shares within your Pep. Of course, the capital gains tax\\nexemption is an added bonus.\"},\n",

It is not clear how 'publicised' will be defined, and whether a\\ndog-eared announcement on a dark corner of a board next to the Health and\\nSafety at Work Act notice will qualify.\\nThe potential size of share scheme rewards has also been increased.

There was no new\\nproduct to rival last year's Tessa, but there was plenty to keep the\\nfinancial adviser busy.\\nOne prominent area was the continuing crackdown on employee perks. The tax\\nadvantages offered by company cars have been steadily under assault during\\nthe 1980s, and there was a further attack, including the imposition of\\nemployers' national insurance charges, this time. Mobile phones, if\\navailable for personal use, also became a taxable benefit.\\nThe idea is that employees should, in the long run, be taxed equally,\\nwhether they are paid in kind or in cash. This principle of fiscal\\nneutrality also showed itself when the chancellor abolished higher-rate tax\\nrelief on mortgage interest payments.\\nThat change had been expected for some time, and was softened by the\\nsimultaneous increase in the higher-rate tax threshold. Another area where\\naction had been widely anticipated was offshore trusts.\\nBy rolling up their investments offshore in a trust, some well-off\\nindividuals had been able to postpone, in some cases virtually indefinitely,\\nthe payment of capital gains tax.\\nAlthough it will still be possible to delay tax on an offshore trust's gains\\nuntil a capital payment is made to a UK resident beneficiary, a supplemental\\ncharge will be added. This will be, in effect, a charge on the deferred tax\\nwhich 'should' previously have been paid on the gains rolling up in the\\ntrust. The charge will be levied at 10 per cent of the deferred tax for\\nevery year, up to a maximum of six, that the gain is held in the trust\\nbefore being paid out.\\nThe change will remove many of the apparent advantages of having an offshore\\ntrust; but Caroline Garnham, tax partner with solicitors Taylor Joynson\\nGarrett, feels that the supplemental charge may be so complicated to\\nadminister that it will be abolished before it reaches the statute book.\\nThe Revenue also produced a consultative document about onshore trusts,\\nwhich represented an attempt to simplify the rules on trust taxation.

       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-3018, TEXT: WITH THIS third issue of the Quarterly Review, we can celebrate a change to\\nan altogether more favourable climate for long-term investors.\\nOctober, focusing on the state of the markets as at the end of September,\\nsentiment was at its gloomiest level for years. As for the January issue,\\nwith the long-threatened Gulf war in full swing the risks became\\naccentuated. But so did the potential opportunities. Our conclusion then was\\nthat shrewd investors might need to be brave, but that the next few months\\nwould throw up considerable opportunities.\\nSo it has indeed proved. And whereas, in the depths of winter, it may have\\nseemed hard to take the optimistic line, in spring the investor's fancy may\\nbe more easily tickled. But stock-market folklore brings due warnings ('sell\\nin May . . .'), and enthusiasm needs to be kept well under control. There\\nare no easy roads ahead.\\nRarely has the gulf of understanding between the securities markets and\\nprivate investors been wider than during the past few months. And yet\\nstudents of the markets will argue that there has been a classical pattern\\nto the sequence of events.\\nFirst, a few numbers. During the January-March quarter, the UK stock market\\nrose by an impressive 16 per cent. This is on the basis of the broadest\\nmeasure of the market's level, the FT- Actuaries All-Share Index which has\\nsome 670 constituents. The total gain by the All-Share since its low point\\nat the end of September last year was 24 per cent.\\nBy any standards, the past six months has therefore been an excellent period\\nfor investing in Ordinary shares in Britain, and the same applies to most\\ncountries around the world.\\nTo get an idea of the global trend, we must look at the FT-Actuaries World\\nIndex, and this rose by 21 per cent in sterling terms during the\\nJanuary-March quarter, boosted by the 26 per cent jump by the US national\\nindex. The World Index has scored its impressive gain in the face of a\\nconsiderable economic recession in several major countries, including the US\\nand the UK.\\nTo some extent, the lifting of the war threat may be credited for the\\nimprovement in conditions. Last autumn there were fears of military\\ncatastrophe in the Gulf, and of crude-oil prices soaring to Dollars 70 a\\nbarrel or more. In the end, allied losses were light and the Saudi Arabian\\noil production and refining facilities escaped untouched. That was been\\ntransmitted to the financial markets.\\nBut broader economic developments also played an important role. It has\\nbecome evident progressively during the last six months that the US has\\nentered a significant recession and the UK a quite severe one. Those weak\\nconditions have spread to much of Europe, certainly to France and Italy. But\\nGermany has continued to boom, recording economic growth of above 4 per\\ncent; and the Japanese economy has also continued to grow, although at a\\nprogressively more moderate rate.\\nThese divergences have fiercely pulled the markets in different directions.\\nIn particular, the first quarter of the year saw a dramatic realignment of\\nthe dollar and the Deutsche Mark, the latter dragging with it the whole of\\nthe European Monetary System, including of course sterling with effect from\\nlast October. On January 1, the dollar would buy DM1.495; on March 31, 14\\nper cent more at DM1.701.\\nThis had the effect of turning the US stock market into a surprising winner\\nfor many international investors, including those in Britain. Wall Street\\nwas strong, and the strength of the dollar ladled cream on the top. Thus,\\nspecialist American unit trusts, dogs for so much of the recent past,\\ndominated the quarter's performance tables, with the best funds providing\\ngains to UK investors of more than 40 per cent.\\nJust why recession should spell so much profit is bound to be mystifying to\\nmany amateur investors. It should be emphasised, however, that there is\\nnothing unusual about it. Classically, the biggest percentage gains in US\\nstock-market indices are seen during the closing months of a period of\\neconomic recession. The market reacts to falling interest rates and\\nanticipates the recovery in economic activity.\\nstock-market rally, when the bond markets staged their own revival.\\nAccording to the textbooks, equity markets follow a few months behind bond\\nmarkets. The worry now must be that in Britain, for instance, the gilt-edged\\nmarket ran out of steam back in the middle of February, and long-term\\ninterest rates have drifted up to the wrong side of 10 per cent.\\nThis is partly because the inflation news has tended to be disappointing,\\nbut more tangibly because Norman Lamont's Budget last month confirmed that\\nthe government will become a big borrower again, for the next two or three\\nyears at least.\\nIn February and March, as the UK stock market soared towards its all-time\\npeaks in nominal terms, investors were making big bets on the ability of the\\neconomy to bounce back. So it will, but it may take longer than the dominant\\noptimists have been assuming.\\nUnfortunately the stock markets have become more than usually unstable\\nplaces. They are dominated by professional investors who tend to think\\nalike. Last year it was regarded as a clever idea to hold a lot of cash,\\nwhich could earn 15 per cent, but when the stock market is rising rapidly\\nthe cost of such strategies can be very high. At the beginning of 1991, the\\nbig investment institutions are reckoned to have been holding around Pounds\\n35bn in liquid assets, and this was always going to pose the danger of a\\nphase of panic buying.\\nThere is now a danger of further volatility, this time possibly in the other\\ndirection, as investors assess the realities of the industrial recession and\\nthe risks of political upsets as we head towards the next general election.\\nBut those investors who wisely bought around the lows of last autumn and\\nagain in early January need not worry that they will forfeit all of their\\ngains.\"},\n",

       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-3020, TEXT: THE EMERGENCE of natural gas as the fuel of choice in Europe presents a\\npromising investment theme for the 1990s. The main competitors to gas - oil,\\ncoal and nuclear power - have become less attractive in recent years to West\\nEuropean governments and consumers alike on environmental and inflationary\\ngrounds.\\nOn a longer term view, the market for gas supply could become more\\ncompetitive as the European Commission attempts to liberalise the industry\\nby loosening the grip of entrenched monopoly suppliers.\\nKleinwort Benson, the London stockbroker, estimates that West European gas\\ndemand will rise from a current 25bn cubic feet a day to 36.3bn cubic feet\\nby 2,000 and 48bn cubic feet by 2,010. Much of this increase will be met by\\nEurope's main producers - the UK, the Netherlands and Norway - but imports\\nfrom Algeria and the Soviet Union are also likely to rise.\\nInvestors wanting exposure to the growing demand for gas in Europe have\\nvarious options, says Mr Philip Lambert, the author of Kleinwort Benson's\\ngas review. Royal Dutch/Shell's position in European gas is second to none\\nand it has a strong presence in most of the transmission companies in\\nEurope.\\nNorsk Hydro is an obvious beneficiary of the increase in Norwegian gas\\nvalue. Not only is it likely that Norsk Hydro's gas production will nearly\\ntriple to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day (boe/d) over the next 10\\nyears, but its 6.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of proven or probable gas\\nreserves - until recently regarded as uncommercial  - could soon become its\\nmost valuable asset. Norway's Saga Petroleum is an even purer play than\\nNorsk Hydro, which also has aluminium, fertiliser and petrochemical\\ninterests.\\nItaly's gas market should be viewed as the most bullish in Europe, in spite\\nof the 24 per cent market share that natural gas already has of the primary\\nenergy market. Kleinwort Benson forecasts that this will rise to 30 per cent\\nby 2,000, since Italy has abandoned nuclear power and is under pressure to\\nreduce dependence on oil, which accounts for 58.2 per cent of the energy\\nmarket. Italgas, a quoted distribution company, looks attractive on a\\nthree-year view, during which the dividend should begin to rise in line with\\nthe growth of its gas business.\\nThe jump in demand could help small independent suppliers and gas traders\\ntrying to break into the European Community market, but for this to happen\\nthe Commission would have to pass legislation to further open up the gas\\nmarket.\\nEurope's gas market is controlled by a small group of monopoly suppliers\\nwhich control production, transmission and distribution. Gaz de France,\\nSNAM, in Italy, British Gas, in the UK, Ruhrgas, in Germany, and Gasunie, in\\nthe Netherlands, are very large players. Where a statutory monopoly is not\\nin place many countries allow a major supplier to retain its dominance.\\nBut the Commission has challenged the entrenched monopolies that exist in\\nthree EC countries for the import and export of gas by initiating legal\\nproceedings against France, Denmark and Belgium. In spite of deep opposition\\nfrom the gas suppliers, the Commission wants to institute a policy of open\\naccess in the EC, whereby independent suppliers would be allowed access to\\nexisting pipelines for gas transport to customers.\\nElf Aquitaine is a major oil producer trying to gain greater access to the\\nEC gas market. Natural gas already accounts for around one-seventh of Elf's\\nearnings per share, and Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, its chairman, has said\\nrecently that the monopoly gas suppliers will have to face more competition\\nin future. Elf has gas reserves of some 1,500bn cubic feet in its Lacq\\ndeposit in south-west France, and has tried to gather more gas by taking a\\n50 per cent stake in Agas, the UK independent gas company, and a link with\\nWintershall, in Germany. A partial privatisation of Gaz de France is\\npossible over the coming years, and both Elf and Total are known to be\\ninterested.\\nAfter the UK, Germany probably operates one of the most open gas markets in\\nEurope; but Ruhrgas, owned by a consortium of oil companies, dominates\\ntransmission and owns a large chunk of the pipeline system. Wintershall, the\\nenergy subsidiary of the BASF chemicals group, is challenging this\\nstranglehold with plans to build its own distribution system and allow other\\ncompanies, such as Elf and Austria's OMV, to transport their gas through it.\\nIt is the leading chemical companies such as BASF and Dow Chemical - large\\nusers of gas - which are pushing strongly for a policy of open access in gas\\nsince they argue that this will reduce gas prices. The gas companies say it\\nwill take away the incentive to invest in long-term projects in an industry\\nwith extremely long lead times. This, says the suppliers, will reduce the\\nsecurity of supply for consumers.\"},\n",

Producers complain that open markets, such\\nas the LME, create unnecessary price volatility. By contrast, metal-users\\nlike the transparency which open markets bring.\\nProducers have been strongest in those metal markets where they are few  -\\nnotably in aluminium and nickel. Companies in these areas consistently\\nopposed the use of LME aluminium and nickel contracts after they were\\nlaunched in the late 1970s, although they have since accepted their\\npopularity among consumers.\\nLME officials say the biggest support for a secondary aluminium contract is\\nin Europe - where there is a plethora of users in different countries -\\nfollowed by North America.\\nOpposition is strongest in Japan, not least because the buying side is\\ndominated by the large auto companies which are able to get good terms from\\nthe processors without the need for an open-market contract.\\nThe Japan Aluminium Refiners' Association told the LME that they feared the\\ncontract would encourage speculation and breed volatility. But Mr John\\nWolff, the LME chairman, said yesterday that the opportunity to hedge would\\nprotect companies against price swings.\\nThe Japanese side was not convinced. The often cosy relations between\\nproducers and consumers in the Japanese market mean that scrap prices in\\nJapan do not swing as wildly as in Europe and North America. Japanese\\nprocessors, for the most part, would like preserve that situation.\\nThe LME does not want to impose a new contract unilaterally on Japanese\\nindustry, not least because the Pacific region, including Japan, accounts\\nfor about one third of members' business.\\nBut Japanese opposition alone is unlikely to block the launch.

However, Qantas is in a much weaker position. The airline misjudged\\nthe growth of the tourist market after the boom during Australia's\\nbicentenary in 1988, and geared up too quickly to deal with growth which has\\nnot happened.\\nAs a result, it will have to sack between 3,000 and 5,000 of its 20,000\\nstaff to get back into line with the productivity levels of competing\\nairlines. More drastic surgery is being considered by Coopers & Lybrand, the\\naccountants, which will produce a crisis report for the airline's board in\\nMay.\\nQantas further damaged its image last month when details emerged of a series\\nof secret agreements with Brierley Investments, American Airlines and Japan\\nAir Lines hatched during the joint takeover of Air New Zealand in 1989.\\nThe agreements caused Qantas to pay a higher price than its partners for Air\\nNew Zealand shares, and committed it to subsidise dividends to Brierley and,\\nin some cases, top up the return from future sales of shares.\\nQantas says the secret deal was justified because it conferred partial\\ncontrol of an important competitor, and blocked a rival bid which would have\\nallowed British Airways to build a powerful South Pacific hub.\\nNevertheless, the episode weakened the already insecure position of Qantas\\nmanagement in Canberra, and helps explain the government's decision to\\nreject the airline's plans to acquire up to 25 per cent of Australian to\\nprotect its access to domestic traffic.\\nThe decision prompted an angry response from Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman,\\nwho said the airline was being excluded from the domestic market at the same\\ntime as the government was encouraging overseas competitors to buy a stake\\nin Australian.\\nIronically, the explanation offered by government advisers is that allowing\\nQantas to enter the domestic market would make it difficult to refuse an\\ninternational licence to Ansett, which would then be in a position to\\ncompete with Qantas.\\nThe value of the two airlines is unclear because of the difficulty of\\njudging the premium which overseas airlines may be willing to pay for\\nstrategic reasons. The government has also muddied the waters by indicating\\nthat it will strengthen the balance sheets of both airlines before the sales\\nbegin.\\nGovernment officials are still working on the size of the proposed capital\\ninjections, but airline executives say Qantas has debts of more than\\nADollars 3bn compared with equity of around ADollars 1bn, and requires\\nbetween ADollars 600m and ADollars 1bn to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio to\\nmore acceptable levels.

He is a hero in the public sector\\nand the central figure in a sweeping and increasingly combative\\nreorganisation of Spanish utilities by the government.\\nHe is irritated that two of his biggest private sector rivals, Hidrola and\\nIberduero, are thinking about merging in order to confront the\\nreorganisation ordered by Madrid.\\n'It would not promote competition,' he says. 'In fact, it would be against\\ncompetition. I cannot compete with a group that has practically all the\\n(low-cost) hydroelectric capacity in the country.'\\nSpain's electricity is generated by more than 20 companies, many of them\\nsmall with tiny regional distribution rights. Most own only a half or a\\nthird of a power plant. Because tariffs have been unified, the government\\nhas had to erect a frighteningly complex compensation system where low-cost\\nproducers pay out to high-cost rivals according to standard asset values\\nheld by the companies.\\nThe reorganisation 'which uses the new British model as a form of\\nconfirmation', says Mr Fuster, is designed to create just a few large\\ngenerators.\\n'The efficiency of the sector has not been exactly fantastic,' he says,\\npointing out that the industry has short and long-term debts of around\\nDollars 40bn, even though final tariffs are roughly similar to other\\nEuropean countries. 'We are a collection of geographic monopolies. Why\\nshould the sector stay as it is simply because it has traditionally been\\nthat way?'\\nIf that sounds defensive, it is. Endesa has been fiercely criticised for\\nabandoning its role as a wholesale power supplier to the private utilities,\\nwhich are obliged to buy some of their power at a rate fixed by the\\ngovernment.\\nIn 1989, it bought 9.2 per cent of Sevillana, the Andalucian generator and\\ndistributor. Earlier this year it bought 80 per cent of Electra de Viesgo in\\nnorthern Spain, and smaller packages of shares in Union Fenosa, also in the\\nnorth, and Fecsa, the Catalan utility. The president of one Spanish bank\\nwith large holdings in the sector says this amounts to little more than the\\nnationalisation of the industry.\\nNonsense, says Mr Fuster. 'If we wanted to control Sevillana we would have\\nbought it. What do they accuse us of? Buying 10 per cent of Sevillana? Banco\\nBilbao Vizcaya bought 10 per cent just after us and no one said a thing. We\\nbought that stake because we and Sevilla have a lot of business together.'\\n'We should not be talking about whether we are public sector or private\\nsector. We should be talking about whether we are efficient or not. Endesa\\nis not the state. We are a company in which the state holds a 75 per cent\\nstake. (The other 25 per cent was floated in Spain and New York three years\\nago). We are not nationalising. We are offering public sector management.'\\nThat management has not served Endesa badly. It is the state holding\\ncompany, the Instituto de Industria's (INI), most profitable company,\\nearning some Pta80bn (Dollars 741m) after tax last year.\\nThe fact that Endesa, when it was the sector's ugly duckling, was forced to\\nconcentrate on coal-fired thermal power, while the private sector was\\nallowed to build hydro-electrical and nuclear plants, has been turned on its\\nhead. Even independent analysts believe it is the most specialised and\\nefficient thermal power generator in the country now.\\nHowever the carping from the private sector will not go away, largely\\nbecause Mr Fuster's acquisitions have placed Endesa in a strong position to\\nhead one of the two or three groups - he would rather see Hidrola and\\nIberduero each controlling a separate combine - that emerge from the\\nreorganisation.\\nAny reorganisation of the sector will involve a huge interchange of assets\\nbetween the final sector leaders in order to ensure they have roughly\\nsimilar production mixes. Holding on to 11.5 per cent of Fecsa, 5.7 per cent\\nof Union Fenosa, and 9.2 per cent of Sevillana means Endesa has something to\\nswap. Viesgo, Mr Fuster says, will probably be sold on again as part of an\\nasset swap.\\nWhatever the private sector and its banking partners do, Endesa is probably\\nunstoppable. Mr Fuster and the government are convinced that larger\\ngenerating companies will allow the industry to cut costs and replace\\nover-regulation with real competition.\"},\n",

'The days when banks\\nwould clamour to lend at very fine margins are over.'\\nThe trend reflects the return of a seller's market as banks concentrate on\\nsecuring adequate returns on their capital.\\nTheir changed priorities stem partly from the need to satisfy capital\\nadequacy requirements and comply with the Bank for International\\nSettlements' capital ratios.\\n'The Basle ratios are driving the pricing policy of the banking system,'\\nsays Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank.\\nCompanies have observed less of an increase in the prices of day-to-day cash\\nmanagement tools. These, they note, do not entail the commitment of valuable\\nbank capital.\\nMr Ian Duncan, finance director of Tomkins, the conglomerate, says: 'The\\nmarket is as competitive as ever for forward rate agreements (FRAs), swaps\\nand large foreign exchange transactions.'\\nBut they say that banks are noticeably reluctant to agree to loan requests\\nunder uncommitted credit facilities.\\n'We have experienced a number of cases of banks not being willing to lend on\\nuncommitted lines, particularly when the loan period would take in the end\\nof the quarter, when their balance-sheets are being assessed,' says BTR's Mr\\nBull.\\nThe credit squeeze has given a boost to relationship banking, which had been\\nexposed to intense pressure while price competition was keen.\\n'The reason people are emphasising relationships now is that they have to,'\\nsays Mr Andrew Robb, finance director of Pilkington, the glassmaker. 'The\\nbanks just doing transactions - the Japanese in particular - have gone\\nhome.'\\nBlue chips say they never abandoned relationship banking because of its many\\nadvantages.

'Clearly one has\\nto take what is available in the market at the best rates.'\\nOthers achieved a similar goal by putting multi-option facilities (Mofs) in\\nplace, tying their lenders up in one facility at a lower cost than a\\nbilateral overdraft agreement or a syndicated term loan.\\n'Our Mof didn't cost me more than 2-3 basis points,' says Mr Nigel Turnbull,\\nfinance director of Rank Organisation, the leisure group.\\nBTR's Mof, arranged in 1987, provided the group with Pounds 500m in a\\nstandby line of credit for at least five years at an annual average cost of\\n3 1/2 basis points.\\nThe lenders hoped to benefit by supplying all of their customers' ancillary\\nbanking requirements. But, with up to 20 banks typically bidding for the\\nwork, the customers were usually assured a competitive quotation.\\nMost transaction-oriented banks have now departed the fray, reducing the\\nblue chips' bargaining power, and new Mofs are scarcer than hens' teeth.\\nFurthermore, lending for some purposes - for example, to buy property - is\\nhard to find at any price.\\n'Very few banks or investors are interested in property finance,' says Mr\\nDonald Main, finance director of Trusthouse Forte, the hotels group.\\n'We have seen pricing this year go shooting up,' says Mr Turnbull of Rank.\\n'If we tried to put the same committed lines in place it would cost us at\\nleast 50 basis points more than it would have two years ago.'\\nThe situation may get worse, from a corporate perspective, before it gets\\nbetter.\\nNatWest's Lord Alexander said last month that 'corporate customers may well\\nfind that available funds will continue to decline in real terms, and that\\nthe price of those funds will continue to rise, even for the larger\\ncompanies, to a 1 per cent margin.'\\nEventually, however, the finance directors of most blue chips expect the\\navailability of cheap finance to increase as pressures on banks ease.

For the next\\ncentury, the nuclear option will remain impossible to do without.'\\nBut ask an equally informed commentator like Mr Steve Thomas, nuclear expert\\nat Sussex University's science policy research unit, and the emphasis is\\ndifferent: 'With existing technologies, nuclear power is already on a path\\nof slow, but inexorable decline. World capacity is at or very near a peak it\\nmay never exceed.'\\nA similar polarisation of views occurs whenever two or more nuclear pundits\\nare gathered together. Over the past year, however, there has been one\\nchange: nuclear enthusiasts say they detect the first tentative signs of a\\nrevival, particularly in Europe, as memories of Chernobyl fade.\\nOn the face of it, the evidence to support this claim is thin. Nuclear power\\nstation construction remains at a very low ebb. Only two new nuclear plants\\nbegan operating in Europe last year, Penly in France and Neckarwestheim, the\\nlast remaining order in Germany. France and the UK are alone in western\\nEurope in having nuclear stations under construction.\\nYet some recent developments have given hope to the still powerful nuclear\\nlobby. Sweden, boasting the world's largest nuclear power output per head,\\nhas reversed the decision made in 1988 to begin phasing out nuclear power\\nfrom 1995. Facing the prospect of an energy shortfall, many observers now\\nexpect Sweden's 12 nuclear power plants to complete their natural lives.\\nIn a referendum last September, 53 per cent of Swiss voters opposed the\\nabandonment of nuclear power, though an almost equal number supported a\\n10-year moratorium on licensing new facilities.\\nThe industry also hopes that the government elected in Finland in March will\\ngive the go-ahead for a fifth nuclear reactor. It detects signs of a\\nre-think among politicians in Italy, where there has been a moratorium on\\nnuclear power since a referendum in 1987.\\nMore important still are indications that east European countries will not\\nabandon nuclear power, despite Chernobyl. Political liberalisation has,\\nhowever, led to a re-appraisal of the Soviet-designed reactors, many of\\nwhich fell far short of western standards. The five nuclear stations\\noperating at the start of 1990 in east Germany, for instance, were all\\nclosed down for safety reasons.\\nBut east Europe has an equally pressing environmental problem - its\\nover-reliance on hugely polluting coal-fired stations. Some countries may\\nplump for nuclear reactors designed to western standards as a partial\\nsolution. Czechoslovakia has signed separate agreements with the French and\\nwith Westinghouse of the US, both aimed at developing its nuclear industry,\\nwhich accounts for 28 per cent of its electricity generation. Bayenwerk,\\nPressenelektra and RWE, the three main German utilities, have plans to build\\nmodern nuclear reactors at the east German sites of Greifswald and Stendal,\\nwhich housed Soviet-designed plant.\\nIf these are the seeds of hope for the industry, there is still plenty to\\nworry about. Six smaller European countries - Austria, Denmark, Greece,\\nIreland, Norway and Portugal - have no nuclear power and show no signs of\\nwanting it.\\nAttempts to expand the industry in Spain have run into the brick wall of\\nsocialist government disapproval and public distrust following a serious\\nfire at the Vandellos reactor in 1989. Environmental opponents are still\\nactive, notably in Germany, where some nuclear stations have been shut down\\nfollowing successful challenges to their operating licences in the courts.\\nIn all the struggles between the industry and its opponents, three issues\\ntend to dominate:\\nPolitical support.

One example was a strongly worded\\nstatement backing nuclear's revival issued last month by Belgium, Britain,\\nFrance and Germany.\\nUK ministers regularly stress their backing for a continued nuclear\\nprogramme, even though they are committed to a neutral review of the\\nindustry in 1994, the scheduled completion date for the Sizewell nuclear\\nstation. The next general election is perhaps the most important factor,\\nsince the Labour party opposes more stations after Sizewell.\\nEnvironmentalists believe the industry and its government supporters are\\nfooling themselves when they detect the beginnings of a public groundswell\\nbehind nuclear power again.\\n'They are under-estimating, one, the public sentiment against nuclear power\\nand, two, the degree to which the organisation of the environmental movement\\nhas improved incredibly in the last few years,' says Mr John Willis, nuclear\\npower co-ordinator at Amsterdam-based Greenpeace International. Environment.\\nIn a neat reversal of roles, the nuclear industry is on the side of the\\nangels on one environmental issue. Unlike coal, oil and gas, nuclear power\\ndoes not create carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. 'The growing\\nconcern about environmental problems and the recommendations at national and\\ninternational levels for limiting air-polluting emissions, bring rather\\nstrong prospects for a substantial increase in the production of electricity\\nthrough nuclear power,' says the EC's Mr Charrault.\\nThe green groups are keen to kill this argument stone dead. They argue that\\nthe choice between carbon-emitting coal and nuclear power is a false one.\\nThere are other options, notably energy conservation. 'Nuclear is a silly\\noption for dealing with the greenhouse effect,' says Mr Willis. 'Any\\nsensible business person would go for the least cost option.'\\nCosts. Two events have focused concern on the cost question. The first was\\nChernobyl itself, since it led governments and utilities to ponder the huge\\npotential liabilities if a nuclear disaster occurred in a democratic\\ncountry.\\nThe second was the UK government's botched attempt to privatise its nuclear\\nindustry. The cold eye turned by the financial community on nuclear's costs\\nrevealed as misleading its repeated claims to be supplying cheap power. Even\\nNuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear operator in England and Wales, now\\nadmits that power from Sizewell will cost 5.2p a unit (kilowatt/hour),\\ncompared with 2.9p from a new gas station.\\nThe nuclear industry believes smaller, better-designed reactors will cut\\ncosts and help to reassure the public on safety. The main manufacturers -\\nWestinghouse of the US, a joint venture between Framatome of France and\\nSiemens of Germany, Mitsubishi of Japan and Asea Brown Boveri, the\\nSwedish-Swiss engineering group - are all working on innovative designs.\\nBut there is a problem: how to finance the multi-billion dollar cost of\\nbringing these designs to full commercial development. The obvious answer -\\npersuading the electricity utilities to place orders  - seems blocked.\\nNuclear generating capacity in western Europe tripled over the 1980s,\\nlargely thanks to orders placed in the 1970s. This bonanza is unlikely to\\nrepeat itself.\\nEven nuclear enthusiasts acknowledge that prospects are dim in the US.\\nFrance, arguably the world's most successful nuclear nation, has reached\\nsaturation point. Belgium is similarly placed. Some experts also say that no\\nnew orders are expected in west Germany for 10 years.\\nThis leaves Japan, where public opposition is growing; some newly\\nindustrialised countries such as South Korea; eastern Europe; and a few\\norders here and there in western European countries like the UK, Finland and\\nthe Netherlands, if political constraints can be overcome. Nukem, the\\nnuclear consultancy subsidiary of Germany's RWE, forecasts that 12 new\\nnuclear reactors may be ordered and operating in western Europe (including\\neast Germany) by 2005. Even this, however, does not add up to a healthy diet\\nfor an industry with such a capacious financial appetite.\\nElectricity utilities in much of the world face similar financial pressures\\nto those in the US, where power companies are plumping for smaller, cheaper\\ngas plants which do not bear the potential liabilities of a nuclear\\ndisaster.\\nThe nuclear lobby points out that some 100 European reactors will reach the\\nend of their operating lives over the next 30 years. But to enjoy its share\\nof the feast, this troubled industry will have to survive the next decade,\\nwhen there is little reason to expect many of the new orders will be\\nnuclear.\\nThis feature article was written by David Thomas, FT natural resources\\neditor, before he left for Kuwait, where he died on Wednesday.\"},\n",

With these celebrated\\nwords, delivered in 1946, Winston Churchill recognised the onset of the Cold\\nWar and the post-war division of Europe. The curtain remained down for 43\\nyears and then in just a few months was torn asunder. But, as President Lech\\nWalesa of Poland remarked during his visit to the UK, 'the political iron\\ncurtain should not be replaced by a silver curtain of indifference'. For so\\nlong victims of the Soviet determination to keep them in, must the peoples\\nof eastern and central Europe now be victims of the European Community's\\nwish to keep them out?\\nNo people struggled to tear down the curtain as bravely as the Poles. Lech\\nWalesa is the symbol of a victorious struggle in which, as he says, 'the\\npeaceful overthrow of communism in Poland changed the visage of the\\ncontinent and paved the way back for other countries of central and eastern\\nEurope to the family of free nations'.\\nLike other post-communist countries, Poland puts its relations with the\\nEuropean Community at the heart of foreign policy, domestic politics and\\neconomic reform. It regards membership as the main safeguard for its\\ndemocracy and liberal trade as the chief stimulus to its economy. Yet the\\nleaders of the European Community seem to regard what the Polish government\\nrefers to as 'giving Europe back to Poland and Poland to Europe' as at least\\nan embarrassment, if not as a nuisance.\\nLiberal trade\\nTrue, EC foreign ministers have now accepted that membership may figure in\\nthe preamble to the prospective association agreement as 'an ultimate,\\nthough not an automatic' goal. EC members have also consented to a 50 per\\ncent reduction in Poland's external debt. However welcome, these concessions\\nare not enough. Poland needs more than promises for the distant future; it\\nneeds more than debt forgiveness; and it needs more than aid. Poland needs\\nliberal trade.\\nPoland seeks a free trade area with the EC, for essentially all products,\\none that would ensure stability of market access for Polish exports (about\\nhalf of which already go to the EC) and would also enable Poland to maintain\\nthe open import system it now enjoys.\\nMarket access\\nLiberal access to EC markets matters to Poland for four reasons: first, the\\nEC is already by far Poland's most important trading partner and, with the\\nvirtually complete collapse of exports to the Soviet Union, its significance\\nmust grow; second, greater outward orientation is an essential element in\\nthe reform of the Polish economy; third, rapid growth of exports is a\\nnecessary condition for service of debt and attraction of new capital; and,\\nfinally, liberal access to EC markets is the only way that the Polish\\ngovernment can persuade its people to tolerate liberalism at home.\\nAt present Poland's exports of agricultural commodities, of textiles and\\nclothing and of steel, which account for about half its exports to the EC,\\nare under various kinds of restraint. Those restraints did not prevent\\nPoland from achieving rapid growth of exports last year, but are bound to\\nlimit Poland's long-term capacity to exploit its comparative advantage.\\nThe problem for the EC is that it is committed to offerring asymmetric\\nadvantages to Poland, but finds that Poland's trade regime is more liberal\\nthan its own. How difficult EC negotiators must find it to deal with a\\ncountry that embraces both the EC and liberal trade] Unfortunately, the EC's\\nresponse seems to be to recommend more protection to Poland rather than\\nembrace more liberalism for itself.\\nThe leaders of the EC must raise their gaze from their collective navel,\\nfrom butter mountains and farmers' votes and even from inter-governmental\\nconferences. They can choose to create something that has never before\\nexisted: a Europe whole, peaceful and prosperous; or they will bear\\nresponsibility for Latin American-style chaos and instability on their\\neastern borders. President Walesa has thrown down the challenge. Dare\\nEuropean leaders not pick it up?\"},\n",

But as the deluge subsides\\nand the waters fall short, we see the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and\\nTyrone emerging once again. The integrity of their quarrels is one of the\\nfew institutions that has been unaltered in the cataclysm which has swept\\nthe world.' - Winston Churchill, after the first world war in 1922.\\nJohn O'Hara, a 42-year-old Roman Catholic taxi driver, did not know he was\\npart of a grotesque overture to historic talks on Northern Ireland's future\\nas he drove to collect a fare in south Belfast last week.\\nHours earlier loyalist paramilitaries had announced the suspension of\\n'operational hostilities' once talks started. There was a whiff of hope in\\nthe province, as if light had crept beneath the smog of deep sectarian\\nhatred which has engulfed Northern Ireland for generations.\\nBut as Mr O'Hara slowed near the Lisburn Road, masked gunmen opened fire. He\\nhad become the fifth taxi driver to be murdered in the province in six\\nmonths, another grim statistic from more than 20 years of the 'Troubles'.\\nNext Tuesday, Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, opens a\\nseries of round-table talks involving the province's political parties, the\\nIrish and UK governments. Just reaching agreement to talk took more than a\\nyear. It will be prefaced with a meeting of British and Irish ministers in\\nLondon today.\\nFor the first time in at least 15 years, political leaders are to sit down\\nand discuss shared problems. The killing will not stop. Men with guns still\\nwalk the streets. But given the tortured politics of Northern Ireland, the\\nvery fact that political leaders are talking is an achievement in itself.\\nOver the next 10 weeks, conflicting pre-conditions and aspirations will be\\njuggled and rejuggled in the hope that enough of them can be reconciled to\\nsecure a lasting settlement. Mr Brooke himself admits the possibility of\\nfailure, saying the obstacles to be overcome may be too great 'to be scaled\\nin the limited time-frame we have given ourselves'.\\nHe has addressed, in the lexicon of the province's politicians, 'the\\ntotality of relationships' within the British Isles. That covers a devolved\\ngovernment in the province itself, relations with the south, and between\\nLondon and Dublin. Talks will start with bilateral meetings, then move to\\ninternal government in the province, before turning to the wider\\nrelationships such as the Anglo-Irish axis.\\nAt the crux are two basic questions. How, and by whom, is Northern Ireland\\nto be run? And what is its relationship with the rest of the British Isles?\\nUltimately the test will be whether shared disillusionment across the two\\ncommunities, allied with political intransigence, will be sufficient to\\novercome decades of mistrust.\\nBut how the agenda will unfold is as clear as Irish mist. Diametrically\\nopposed views have to be accommodated. Many old quarrels have to be\\nforgotten. Northern Ireland remains a black spot of terrorism and\\nunrepresentative government in an increasingly barrier-free Europe.\\nMr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and\\nLabour party, the Rev Ian Paisley and Mr James Molyneaux, the unionist\\nleaders, have been sparring partners for more than 20 years. Some in\\nNorthern Ireland feel progress will come only when the old guard has been\\nreplaced.\\nSinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, along with loyalist\\nparamilitaries, has been excluded from the talks - partly because the\\ngovernment is adamant that no concession must be given to terrorists, partly\\nbecause the main political parties could never be persuaded to sit at the\\nsame table.\\nYet, despite the justifiable qualifications, the latest initiative has,\\nperhaps, a better chance of success than the many plans littering Northern\\nIreland's recent history. Signs of a change of mood are evident.\\nAt least in part, it reflects weariness. In 22 years of 'the Troubles',\\n2,872 people have been killed in Northern Ireland, the overwhelming majority\\nof them civilians.\\nDominating the province's recent politics has been the 1985 Anglo-Irish\\nagreement - a pact which, when signed, led to fiery protests by unionists at\\nthe prominent role it allotted Dublin in the affairs of the province.\\nEffigies of Mrs Margaret Thatcher were burned outside Belfast City Hall.\\nUnionists refused to meet government ministers.\\nNow unionists are prepared to negotiate. Mr Molyneaux and Mr Paisley have\\nresponded to a change of mood among their followers. They realise that many\\n -particularly the young  - no longer accept the old battle cries of 'no\\nsurrender' and 'Dublin rule is Rome rule'.\\nThere is an urgency among all parties to solve at least some of Northern\\nIreland's problems against the backdrop of a Europe striving for greater\\nconvergence. The province cannot afford to become fossilised in its ancient\\nquarrels. There must be proper political representation.\\nAttitudes in London, too, are changing. Mr John Major does not have the same\\nconvictions about Ulster as Mrs Thatcher, who helped forge the 1985\\nagreement, only to be taken aback at the scale of protest from unionists -\\nincluding her own supporters. Subsequently, Mrs Thatcher appeared frustrated\\nwith the whole issue, seeing Northern Ireland in terms of security. Mr\\nMajor's relative ignorance is almost an asset. His instinct, according to\\none senior official is, as on Europe, 'to get in there and negotiate'. He is\\nprepared to listen.\\nAlthough the government in London hopes the talks will help break the cycle\\nof violence, the security dilemma will still exist. There are now more than\\n16,000 army troops in the province. Army action, including house-to-house\\nsearches, alienates munity. Some youths join the paramilitaries just 'to get\\ntheir own back' on the army. So the roundabout of violence is given another\\nspin.\\nUK government policy is to seek a settlement acceptable to the majority of\\npeople. Finances and energies have been directed, since the 1985 agreement,\\nat strengthening community relations and breaking the sectarian divide.\\nMost prominent have been the promotion of integrated schools and\\nhighly-interventionist legislation to end discriminatory employment\\npractices. The economy of the province, where unemployment reaches 50 per\\ncent in some pockets, has been pump-primed with billions of Treasury funds -\\nthe Northern Ireland Office expects to spend Pounds 6.4bn this financial\\nyear.\\nSome successes have been palpable. Ten schools, out of 450 in the province,\\ntake both Protestant and Catholic children - compared with just one a decade\\nago. Jobs have been created in the worst ghettos of Belfast and Londonderry.\\nThe new Fair Employment Commission has exposed companies where Protestants\\nor Catholics have a disproportionate share of jobs. But, given the starkness\\nof sectarian division only the edges have been chipped away.\\nMr Charles Haughey, the Irish Republic's prime minister, has talked of the\\nneed 'to chart a new path which will soften and eventually eliminate the\\ndivisions of the past on this island'. Dublin is willing to contemplate a\\nnew arrangement that would 'transcend' the 1985 pact and, possibly, remove\\narticles two and three from the Irish constitution which lay claim to\\nNorthern Ireland.\\nDublin is aware of changes in its own politics. Half the Irish population is\\nunder 28 and does not carry the emotional baggage associated with a united\\nIreland. A visitor to the republic might be surprised at the public\\nindifference to these talks or to the wider problems of Northern Ireland.\\nBut the sub-text of Irish policy is still the achievement of some form of\\nunitary state. Mr Haughey has spoken of the need to persuade 'our unionist\\ncountrymen that their future lies with us'. This view is shared by the SDLP.\\nAgain, the unionists are seen as the main problem. 'In the SDLP view, the\\ncentral relationship, the one that goes to the heart of the matter, is the\\nunionist people's relationship with the rest of this island, or rather their\\ndistrust of the rest of this island,' says Mr Hume.\\nDuring her election campaign last year Mrs Mary Robinson, Ireland's\\npresident, talked of the need for the republic to 'reach out' to unionists.\\nBut while Mrs Robinson might talk of reconciliation, she has few\\nconstitutional powers and very little influence on the direction of policy.\\nFor their part, the unionists have not rushed to embrace Mrs Robinson.\\nUnderlying the unionists' position is an assumption that the Irish\\nRepublic's claim on Northern Ireland has to be dropped. From Mr Brooke, they\\nhave won an assurance that the province will remain part of the UK as long\\nas a majority of its population want it.\\nAfter that, unionists seek as top priority renegotiation of the Anglo-Irish\\nagreement, a pact which forced the majority community to realise it could\\nnot take sympathetic government from Westminster for granted.\\nUnionists are prepared to contemplate a replacement agreement, insisting\\nthat they are committed to good relations with the south. But they argue\\nIreland's influence must be no more than that of any other 'foreign\\ngovernment'.\\nThat leaves scope for textual barter. Giving Dublin the right to be\\nconsulted on the affairs of the province would not be acceptable. Dublin\\ncurrently has the right to put forward its views through the Maryfield\\nsecretariat outside Belfast. A right to make representations the British\\ngovernment, with a consulate in Belfast, might succeed.\\nOn the question of a devolved government there is more of a muddle. Mr\\nMolyneaux favours a devolved administration fitting 'snugly' into the\\nBritish parliamentary system - suggesting he wants little more than a\\nenhanced 'county council' system.\\nMr Paisley backs full-blown legislative devolution along the lines of the\\nformer Stormont parliament. He rejects the concept of a 'power-sharing\\nexecutive', believing it did not work under the 1973 Sunningdale agreement,\\nan early attempt to give the Roman Catholic community a voice in government,\\nand would give disproportionate power to the minority community.\\nBut, perhaps influenced by the younger generation within the party, most\\nnoticeably Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader, Mr Paisley's Democratic\\nUnionist party is anxious to look for new schemes for sharing executive\\nresponsibility. There is no expectation of a return to strict majority rule.\\nWhat shape then, in an ideal world, might an agreement take if talks were to\\nsucceed? There would almost certainly be a new Northern Ireland\\n'government', subordinate to Westminster and Dublin, in which the voices of\\nunionism and nationalism were carefully proportioned.\\nThe replacement Anglo-Irish agreement would build on a willingness among the\\npeoples of north and south to be 'good neighbours' while accommodating both\\nnationalist and unionist aspirations.\\nIt is a tall order indeed. Most critically, any deal will depend on mutual\\nunderstanding - a sparse commodity in the province. There is no guide to how\\nthe talks will evolve over coming weeks. Northern Ireland officials describe\\nthem as 'organic'.\\nAll parties know they have an opportunity to show progress can be achieved\\nby discussion and not, as the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries would have\\nit, by violence. It is a high-risk business. If there is no success then the\\ngrim and utterly predictable likelihood is more violence.\"},\n",

This time, however, he is occasionally\\ntouched by things I never thought he could show - soul, wit, eloquence,\\ntalent.\\nAs every FT reader of course knows well, an onnagata is a specialist\\ntravesty performer, a male member of the Japanese Kabuki theatre who\\nperforms only female roles. Kemp takes the idea of the onnagata as the\\npremise for what gradually becomes a one-person autobiography, an anthology\\nof Kemp memories. Sounds pretty icky, doesn't it? I was dreading it. For\\nover half of Onnagata, which is a hundred-minute vehicle for him (no\\ninterval), he and his type of theatre revert to their usual kind of dull,\\nincense-laden, narcissistic, tacky mystique. But it is far more\\nforward-moving than most Kemp theatre; and its use of lighting and fabric is\\noften marvellous.\\nKemp's manner tends to be a drag-queeny mix of grande dame and sentimental\\ngrande horizontale. Half of him bravely copes with the ardours of diva-dom,\\nhalf of him basks in fond memories of being a great star, lover, whore,\\nqueen bee, murderess, etc. This persona - which some people find so\\nliberated and liberating - has always struck me as pretty sickly, and I'm\\ngrateful for the unwonted dash of fun he occasionally adds here. And I'm\\nheld by the way he makes Onnagata entirely a personal account. Four other\\nperformers keep reappearing, but veiled and garbed in black - 'invisible'\\nBunraku puppeteer figures.\\nThe best scene - his long initiation and debut as onnagata  - occurs early\\non. As metaphor, it keeps developing. The puppeteers mask, robe and\\ntransform him. (Something of the objective nature of Japanese theatre rubs\\noff on him here.) At one point, he quivers in his robes like a moth;\\nwhereupon flames, carried by the 'invisible' men, are carried onstage. You\\nsee just how the onnagata is both frightened and attracted by performing, is\\nboth trapped and excited. In the slow fan ritual dance that follows, gender\\nreally isn't the point; beauty is.\\nThe scenes that follow, much more obviously sensationalist, are far less\\ninteresting. He 'remembers' being various female figures across history and\\nthe globe. His Salome kisses John the Baptist's head (while a voice sings\\nDalila's 'Mon coeur s'ouvre a ta voix'). His Isadora Duncan does some\\nlumpish half-steps to a Brahms waltz, and his Loie Fuller does some rather\\nfine things with two huge wings of fluttering fabric and changing colours of\\nlight (while - heaven help us  - the Hostias from Verdi's Requiem plays).\\nAnd so on.\\nThe Hostias, like the Cuius Animam from Rossini's Stabat mater, are, of\\ncourse, a cheap ploy to seduce an audience. Go it with God all the way to\\nSodom. Once or twice, however, Kemp really does use them to suggest\\nsomething poignant - that he knows his kind of onnagata is damned but that,\\neven with Heaven's closed gates in sight, he must still pursue his destiny.\\nTripe, but occasionally riveting.\"},\n",

It is,\\nnevertheless, riveting to watch and contains one great redeeming grace:\\nthere is some regret shown at the end for the way Malvolio has been treated.\\nThe director, Griff Rhys Jones, must have made a fundamental decision at the\\nstart. That was to dress the court of Illyria in naval uniform. The decision\\nreduces the romanticism at a stroke. People in uniform walk, behave and even\\nlisten to music in a more formal way than others: they do not fall\\nuncontrollably head over heels in love. The result is that Terence Hillyer's\\nOrsino has no great passion for Olivia: he is coolly detached throughout.\\nOn the other hand, the approach has its compensations. Since Orsino so\\nrapidly changes his affections at the end, there is no reason to believe\\nthat he was much attached to Olivia in the first place. Also, with the naval\\nuniforms comes a relatively austere setting. The colours are darkish: Laura\\nAshley in sombre mood. The restraint is reflected in the playing. This Sir\\nToby Belch (Bill Wallis) does not belch. Even he has been a naval officer in\\nhis time and sometimes wears the uniform to show it. In the late night\\ndrinking scene, he is in white tie and tails. The costumes in general are of\\nthe late Victorian, early Edwardian period that is currently fashionable in\\nShakespeare productions.\\nMuch of the comedy stems from the play as a whole rather than from\\nindividual characters, though there are some inspired moments. When the law\\nintervenes in the duel scene, Sir Toby does a sword dance on the foils as if\\nthat is what he had been doing all along. Olivia (Jane Gurnett) wields a\\nheavier sword than any of them. Ms Gurnett plays the part sensibly and\\nwithout coquettishness: a woman who knows the right man when she sees him.\\nThat seems to me the best way of doing it.\\nWhere Olivia comes into her own is when she realises that her steward,\\nMalvolio, has been maltreated. Her line 'He has been most notoriously\\nabused' is said slowly and with feeling. Malvolio, played by Freddie Jones,\\nleaves the stage with some dignity. His threat to be revenged on the whole\\npack of them is spoken more in sorrow than in anger, and there is some point\\nto Orsino's statement that peace must be made with him. This avoids the\\ncruelty of some productions where Malvolio is treated almost like Shylock.\\nThere is a gloriously flaxen-haired Sir Andrew Aguecheek from Tim McInnerny\\nand I liked Linda Marlowe's Maria, very much a vivacious gentlewoman. Ken\\nWynne's Feste struck me as over-bitter, though this fits with his role in\\ntaunting Malvolio to the end. Altogether this is a more satisfactory\\nproduction of Twelfth Night than the one currently showing at the London\\nPlayhouse by Sir Peter Hall because it is more of a piece.

A few examples of fake pieces have been included in\\nthe show, their modern origin detected because of misunderstood hallmarks.\\nHowever, the fake can also be detected thanks to recent research into the\\nkind of alloy used in Liege, mid-way in quality between Bavaria and Paris.\\nFor the low-brow silver enthusiast, however, the exhibition offers the\\npleasure of a vast and varied hoard of covetable objects, ranging from\\ncoffee-pots and candle-snuffers to sword-hilts, cake-slices, and a\\nclothes-brush. A short didactic section describes the workings of the\\nall-powerful guild of silversmiths. However, the kind of detailed\\ninformation about craftsmen, their workshops and customers which makes\\nstudents of the London silver trade so happy, is missing. When the French\\narmy took Liege in 1794 and, horrible deed, burnt the vast cathedral of St\\nLambert, they also abolished the guilds and the archives vanished.\\nLiege in the Ancien Regime was an unusual place. It was the capital of a\\nprincipality ruled, as it had been since the days of the great Bishop Notker\\nin the 10th century, by a Prince-Bishop. And that, we are told with rather\\ntantalising brevity, accounts for the style of Liege silver. No king meant\\nno vying to impress foreign diplomats and hostile powers, no posturing noble\\ncourtiers. It meant no Madame de Pompadour, no Madame de Montespan. The\\nChurch dominated life in the city; when the bishop died, they changed the\\nhall-marks.\\nCustomers for new silver and those who equally often took heirlooms along to\\nbe refashioned, were either clerics or sober-sided bourgeois. Some\\nimpression of the social setting comes from a reproduction of a painting by\\nthe 18th-century artist, Paul-Joseph Delcloche. It shows the bishop and his\\ndinner-guests supping off oysters. There is plenty of silver about the room\\nand on the table, but by far the richest object is the jewelled crucifix on\\nthe episcopal midriff.\\nSo Liege silverware tends to be elegant and unostentatious, whether the\\npieces are Baroque, Rococo or influenced by the new classicism which creeps\\nin from around 1750. Generally, fashion tends to be ten years behind Paris\\nand London. On the other hand, in terms of technique masterpieces were\\nproduced to match anything which could be brought at more metropolitan\\ncentres. Not all the exhibits come from Liege; there is a group of objects\\nfrom the so-called bonnes villes of the province, such as Maastricht,\\nWaremme and Saint-Trond.\\nSplendid table fountains, containing no one know quite what, were a\\nparticular feature of the Low Countries and there are many in the show,\\nmajestically pear-shaped on three legs. Many coffee-pots and candlesticks of\\nthe 1770s have a violently twisted, swirling form which reminds us that art\\nnouveau was later to flower spectacularly in Belgium.\\nCentre-piece of the exhibition is an elegant table laid for a six o'clock\\ndinner for eight persons. The date would seem to be sometime round the\\n1780s, last years of the good life in rich, tasteful, independent Liege.\"},\n",

As a genre it has been dominated by foreigners.\\nIt is salutary, therefore, to hear a Japanese academic of the stature of\\nProfessor Hajime Yamashina - until recently chairman of the department of\\nprecision engineering at Kyoto University and a man associated with two of\\nJapan's leading business awards, the Production and Maintenance Award and\\nthe Deming Prize - putting so little emphasis on Japan's industrial success\\nin terms of its financial system or industrial structure.\\nInstead, Yamashina, in delivering his Stockton lecture at the London\\nBusiness School last night, located Japan's industrial strength in\\ncompanies' continuous redefinition of what it means to be a competitive\\nmanufacturer in the context of producing 'attractive products with\\nattractive costs'; and, by seeing orginality in the ability to develop and\\nmake products as well as invent them.\\nThis orientation has had important consequences for the deployment of people\\nthroughout a manufacturing company, and the skills of those employed.\\nAs the charts below indicate, the deployment of engineers in Japan is\\ngreater in the design and developmental phases of manufacture than in the\\nwest, and is comparatively weaker at the stage of origination.\\nSignificantly, the stylised Japanese company employs fewer (but more\\nqualified) operators than does its western counterpart.\\nYamashina said that, in the pursuit of competitive manufacturing, Japanese\\nengineers in categories (d) and (e) have been concentrating in three areas:\\nbetter quality control; higher value-added per person; and, shorter lead\\ntimes. All are important, especially the latter.\\nProduct variety is now a given condition of competitive life and, 'there has\\nbeen a growing need for products matching individual persons' circumstances,\\npersonality and tastes which eventually leads to customer orientation\\nproduction, meaning a separate model for every customer'.\\nThe Japanese are great namers of trends and epochs.

But employers which take representational roles\\naway from unions and give them to organisations they have set up themselves\\nare courting serious industrial relations problems. They rarely try it.\\nNorthumbrian Water, which supplies water and treats sewage in the north-east\\nof England, thought the potential rewards were tempting enough for it to\\nmake the attempt, although the value of doing so remains to be seen.\\nFor the moment, however, it is remarkable enough that Northumbrian has\\npersuaded the eight unions which represent its 1,200 strong work-force that\\nthey should give up the lead role in pay negotiations - and that it has done\\nso with remarkably little public criticism from them.\\nThe process the company and the unions have recently completed falls short\\nof derecognition. None the less it will mean a significant diminution in\\npower at Northumbrian for the eight unions - Nalgo, the GMB, the TGWU, Apex,\\nUcatt, the EETPU, the AEU and Nupe - which currently represent the company's\\nemployees.\\nFollowing a recent accord, pay and other matters relating to employees will\\nbe determined at a company council consisting of 11 members, four appointed\\nby management and seven elected (indirectly) by the workforce. Although the\\nunions will elect a representative to advise the council, they will not\\ncontrol the selection of the seven employee councillors.\\nSuch a scheme strikes at the heart of trade unionism. It is hard to imagine\\nanything like it being accepted in union strongholds like local government\\nor large engineering companies. Yet the unions at Northumbrian, the largest\\npart of the Northumbrian Water Group, were not an easy target.\\nThe company is, after all, based in the north-east of England, an area where\\nunion traditions are strong. Although the company says the proportion of\\nemployees in unions has slipped from a peak in 1979 of about 98 per cent,\\nthe present figure, 83 per cent, is still above that at many other\\norganisations.\\nThe industrial relations which Northumbrian has experienced in recent years\\nhardly provided a reason for the company's action. True, there was a 31-day\\nstrike by manual workers in 1983 but that was part of a national stoppage.\\nNational pay bargaining has since been abandoned, following withdrawal by\\nNorthumbrian and Thames Water, and at Northumbrian both unions and\\nmanagement believe their relationship since the 1983 strike has been\\ncordial.\\nWhat then were Northumbrian's motives? Mike Temple, regional personnel\\nadvisor and the man who developed the details of the new system, says that\\nthe company did not deliberately set out to weaken the power of the unions,\\neven though he does not deny that that has been the effect. 'What we wanted\\nwas a better relationship with our employees.'\\nThe change in the role of the unions was not a quantum leap by the company,\\nsays Temple, but part of a gradual process of developing more teamlike,\\ncompany-conscious attitudes. 'We want to get rid of the them and us\\nattitude,' says Temple.\\nThe idea was encapsulated in rather more grand language in a recent message\\nto employees; this said that all employees, whether manual workers or\\nmanagement, were in the same ''big team', with common vision, mission and\\nvalues'.\\nAs part of the unifying process, staff have been taken through two-day\\ncourses, some of which is designed to inculcate values such as recognising\\nother people's points of view and satisfying customer needs. Team briefings\\nhave been introduced to help improve internal communications; team working\\nhas been increased; and the company is gradually bringing in single status\\nconditions by which everyone will work under the same terms of employment,\\nincluding holidays, sick pay and pension benefits.\\nPlenty of other companies have adopted similar strategies but Northumbrian\\nsaw the way the unions functioned as a barrier to creating the 'big team'.\\nTemple says: 'Trade unions have interests other than the pure success of the\\ncompany. They each have full-time officers, they each have their own history\\nand prejudices and they each owe loyalties to the TUC and to members outside\\nthe company.'\\nAt one stage the company considered derecognising all the unions, denying\\nthem any role in the company. However, by the time it announced its plans in\\nNovember, it said it was prepared to recognise one union on the grounds that\\nemployees wanted the security of a trade union to represent them. All very\\nwell, but none of the unions wanted to relinquish its members at the\\ncompany.\\nIn the end a compromise was reached by which all eight agreed to act as one\\nin a confederation. The unions thus kept their members but most employees\\nbelieve union powers at the company were none the less very considerably\\ncurtailed.\\nSince the ending of national bargaining, pay has been determined by a system\\nin which local full-time officers negotiate with the company. Northumbrian\\nsays that in future pay will be determined through the company council,\\nadvised both by a confederation representative and a representative of an\\nemployee association being set up, in part, for non-union members.\\nThe seven company councillors who represent employees will be appointed by\\nmembers of seven local employee councils who in turn have been elected by\\nthe workforce. Issues they will discuss will include health and safety, the\\nrole of the business and its performance, research and development and, of\\ncourse, pay.\\nQuite how pay will be determined is unclear. Temple says he hopes that\\ndecisions can be arrived at through members arriving at a consensus rather\\nthan voting. The decision is then likely to be put to a ballot. What is\\ncertain is that pay rises will be determined through the council, rather\\nthan through talks with full time union officers, says Temple.\\nIn spite of the changes, Don Macrae, district officer of Nalgo, with about\\n350 members the largest union there, says the agreement is a long way from\\nthe derecognition once feared and 'in practical terms may not make that much\\ndifference'.\\nThe unions will have representatives on a standing committee to deal with\\nharmonisation of conditions and Macrae believes this committee could have a\\nsignificant, possibly decisive, influence on pay determination, particularly\\nin the first year.\\nThe union confederation will have a right to represent members involved in\\ndisciplinary procedures and will have safety representatives on each of the\\nseven area councils. Macrae says that the seven company councillors\\nrepresenting employees are also likely to be active union members and that\\nthis has proved to be the case so far.\\nNone the less the compromise is far from what the unions would have liked.\\n'It is what we have got and we will make the best of it,' says Macrae.\\nHow then did Northumbrian achieve the changes so smoothly? The unions\\nconsidered industrial action but it was never a serious proposition. The\\n1983 strike by manual workers proved that it is not easy to stop water\\ncompanies doing their business; water still flows even if significant\\nnumbers of employees are missing.\\nNorthumbrian also helped itself by preparing the ground for change long in\\nadvance. As long ago as February 1988, Sir Michael Straker, the chairman,\\ntold employees that eight trade unions was too many. The creation of the\\ncompany council was hinted at last May when Northumbrian set up the seven\\narea councils. The various steps, and the reasoning behind them, have been\\nexplained through such methods as team briefing.\\nBy the time the proposals were announced there were some unlikely converts\\nto the cause, among them Malcolm Fraser, president of the company's Nalgo\\nbranch.\\nFraser, a union activist for many years, has become the chairman of the\\nemployee association, which many see as a rival to the unions, but sees no\\nconflict with that and his Nalgo position. He says the company had had\\nproblems relating to employees and creating a common purpose because there\\nwere so many different unions and bargaining groups.\\nUnion power was always fragmented because there were so many of them and\\nmanagement always had the upper hand in pay talks because of the lack of\\nmilitancy among employees, he says. 'There was more chance of being kicked\\nto death by a demented donkey than getting members of Nalgo out on strike.'\\nFraser believes the new system will give employees 'two bites of the cherry'\\nbecause the employee association will also involve previously unrepresented\\nnon-union members.\\nAmong ordinary workers, both white- and blue-collar, there is concern that a\\nloss of union power has been designed to weaken the hand of employees. One\\nNalgo member, who works in Northumbrian's head office in Pity Me, County\\nDurham, says he would have preferred the company to have modified the\\nbargaining system rather than replace it.\\nThe main worry is that the employees' lead role in pay determination will be\\nplayed by ordinary workers, unskilled at dealing with management, rather\\nthan full-time union officials. 'People on the company council are not\\nclever enough to represent us,' says Jimmy Metcalfe, a joiner and a member\\nof the Ucatt construction union who has been with the company for 17 years.\\n'The union officials know all the ins and outs. I think pay could suffer.'\\nThe changes, says Metcalfe, appear to be for the company's benefit 'rather\\nthan ours.'\\nComments like that are typical. They demonstrate that the company has some\\nconsiderable way to go before it succeeds in creating the 'big team' which\\nit says is behind the employee representation changes. The challenge is to\\nensure that the employees are not alienated.\"},\n",

Accordingly, where cargo sellers delay the vessel's berthing for\\nloading, but load within the sale contract time at a faster rate than the\\ncontractual minimum, the buyers cannot claim on the basis that loading would\\nprobably have been at that faster rate had there been no delay, and that the\\nvessel would therefore have been freed earlier thus diminishing their\\ndemurrage costs.\\nThe Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by Roplack Enterprises\\nSA, sellers of maize shipped on World Navigation, from Mr Justice Phillips's\\ndecision in favour of the claimant buyers, Kurt A Becher gmbH, on their\\nappeal from the Board of Appeal of the Grain and Feed Trade Association\\n(Gafta).\\nLORD JUSTICE PARKER said that three contracts for the sale of maize provided\\nfor shipment by instalments in April, May and June 1985. The quantity to be\\nshipped in June was 12,000 tonnes.\\nEach contract was on Gafta 64 terms and Argentine Centro terms.\\nClause 7 of Gafta 64 provided that the vessel should load 'in accordance\\nwith the custom at port of loading unless otherwise stipulated'.\\nThe Centro clauses provided that buyers should give 15 days' notice of\\nreadiness to load; and that once the vessel was berthed 'sellers guarantee .\\n. . a minimum average loading rate of 500 tonnes per weather working day,\\nSundays, holidays and Saturday afternoons excepted'.\\nOn May 24 1985 the buyers nominated World Navigation to load the June\\nportion.\\nShe reached Zona Comun on June 13 and tendered readiness to load.\\nShe would have berthed on June 25 had the shippers' loading documentation\\nbeen in order. It was not. She was by-passed by other vessels next in line,\\nand did not berth until July 18.\\nBetween July 18 and July 22 she loaded 24,000 tonnes, including the\\n12,000-tonne June portion.\\nThe buyers claimed the sellers were in breach of contract in not having the\\ngoods ready to load. They contended that damages consisted in demurrage they\\nhad had to pay under the charterparty by which they had provided the vessel.\\nThe sellers disputed the claim. They said they were not in breach of any\\nobligation and even if they were, the buyers had suffered no damage, because\\nif the vessel had kept her turn on June 25 they would have had 48 days to\\nload the 24,000 tonnes, and loading had been completed within that time.\\nAlternatively, to load the 12,000 tonnes they had 24 days, and had completed\\nin time.\\nArbitrators upheld the buyers' claim. The Gafta Board of Appeal allowed an\\nappeal on the ground that the vessel used less than 18 days laytime, whereas\\nthe contract allowed 24 days. Mr Justice Phillips allowed the buyers' appeal\\nand remitted the award to the Board of Appeal for reconsideration in the\\nlight of his judgment. The sellers now appealed.\\nAssuming that the sellers were in breach of contract in not having the\\nnecessary documentation to enable the vessel to keep her turn on June 25,\\nthe first question was what was their obligation with regard to rate of\\nloading once she had berthed?\\nThe buyers contended that although the Centro clause provided for a minimum\\naverage of 500 tonnes per weather working day, the Gafta obligation was to\\nload according to the custom of the port. They said port custom might be to\\nload by a method which would produce a faster rate.\\nMr Justice Phillips rightly rejected that contention.\\nThe Gafta provision was that the vessel was to load in accordance with port\\ncustom 'unless otherwise stipulated'. The Centro clause did otherwise\\nstipulate.\\nUnder that clause the buyer would not be in breach if he maintained an\\naverage of at least 500 tonnes a day.\\nAccordingly, the sellers were entitled, once the vessel was in berth, to\\ntake up to 48 counting days to load the complete cargo, or 24 counting days\\nto load the three contracts.\\nAssuming again that the sellers were in breach in not having the\\ndocumentation ready, the next question was on what basis should damages be\\nassessed?\\nThe buyers contended that, given that the vessel was delayed by the breach,\\nthe proper course was to consider what would probably have happened had\\nthere been no breach. If the probability was that she would have loaded at\\nthe same rate as she actually did unload, they were entitled to damages\\nbecause, but for the breach, the vessel would have been free and demurrage\\nwould have ceased to accrue by July 1.\\nTheir damage, argued the buyers, was the demurrage incurred between July 1\\nand July 22 when the vessel was finally free. What they claimed was the\\nvalue of the lost chance of freeing the vessel earlier.\\nThe sellers contended that no damage had been suffered because, had the\\nvessel berthed on June 26, they would not have been obliged to complete\\nloading and free the vessel any earlier than they did.\\nIn Lavarack v Woods (1967) 1 QB 278 Lord Denning MR in minority said that a\\nwrongfully dismissed servant was entitled to bonuses he might reasonably\\nhave expected to receive, because the employer had deprived him of the\\nchance of receiving them. He said 'he is entitled to compensation for the\\nloss of the chance', even though he had no legal right to receive the\\nbonuses.\\nThe majority would have none of that. Lord Diplock said: 'The law is\\nconcerned with legal obligations only . . . not with expectations, however\\nreasonable.'\\nThe buyers relied on Paula Lee v Robert Zehil (1983) 2 All ER 390,397,393\\nwhere the defendants wrongfully repudiated a contract to buy 16,000 garments\\neach season from the plaintiff dress manufacturer. The plaintiff contended\\nthat damages should be assessed on the average of all his garments. Mr\\nJustice Mustill concluded that damages should be assessed in terms of such\\nreasonable selection of garments as would 'yield the lowest price'.\\nEarlier, however, he said that inquiry into the plaintiff's actual position\\nin face of the breach and his position if the contract had been performed,\\ninvolved 'identification of the promise, followed by a valuation of its\\npromised worth to the promisee'. He said each part of the inquiry might\\ninvolve considering a choice which would have been open to the promisor.\\nMr Justice Phillips identified the broken obligation as a single discrete\\nobligation to procure appropriate loading documents. He said the inquiry\\nconcerned valuation.\\nHe said that when assessing damages the board must ask how long loading\\nwould have taken had World Navigator berthed promptly; and that the question\\nwas to be answered, not by assuming that the sellers would have loaded at\\nthe slowest permissible rate, but by considering all factors that would have\\nbeen likely to influence their conduct.\\nThe judge was right that the breach was of a single discrete obligation. One\\nmust, however, consider the consequences to the buyers of the breach and\\nwhat was required to put them in the same position as if it had not\\noccurred.\\nIn that event laytime would have begun to run on June 26. The sellers'\\nobligation would have been to load in the number of counting days under the\\nCentro terms, but no more.\\nThey did so. Despite the breach the buyers got that to which they would have\\nbeen entitled had there been no breach. To accept the buyers' contention\\nwould be to make the sellers pay damages for failing to do that which they\\nwere not obliged to do.\\nIn the light of those conclusions it was unnecessary to decide the extent of\\nthe sellers' obligation to enable the vessel to reach berth.\\nThe appeal was allowed. The award of the Board of Appeal was affirmed. Their\\nLordships gave concurring judgments.\\nFor the buyers: Martin Moore-Bick QC and Geraldine Clark (Richards Butler)\\nFor the sellers: David Johnson QC and Mark Havelock-Allan (Sinclair Roche &\\nTemperley)\"},\n",

The\\nfirst is next door to a new focal point of the city. The second is part of a\\nscheme to regenerate a rundown district, has received the help of city grant\\nand is the object of a visit today by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment\\nsecretary. But on closer inspection they have elements in common.\\nThe first element is geographical. The schemes are just outside, but at\\nopposite ends of the city centre. They illustrate the way in which the core\\nbusiness district of the city is breaking outwards. This is partly a\\nplanning question: the city council has for some years been seeking to\\ninduce greater vibrancy outside an inner ring road. This carriageway is\\nefficient for through traffic but holds in the city centre like a belt with\\na sealed buckle and is largely responsible for Birmingham's reputation as a\\ncar-crazy city.\\nSo far the private sector has fallen in with the planning aim only to a\\nlimited degree. But Brindleyplace and Waterlinks, coupled with the London &\\nEdinburgh Trust redevelopment of the famous, or notorious, Bull Ring Centre\\nwith its landmark cylindrical tower, and Avatar's Arcadian shopping and\\nleisure development, offer the possibility of a wider and more diverse city\\ncentre.\\nThe concomitant of the geographically-constrained city centre is that the\\ncentral office district is small - too small to cope with the demands which\\nhave been placed upon it. The agents' boards are ready evidence of a\\nplethora of small space, but new buildings with large floors are scarce.\\nResearch by Chesterton, the chartered surveyors, shows that this year more\\nthan 1m sq ft of office space will be completed in the city centre. But a\\nhigh number of pre-lettings means that only 272,000 sq ft of it will find\\nits way on to the market. However, Chesterton notes that, at the end of\\n1990, another 19 schemes, totalling 2.4m sq ft, has outline or detailed\\nplanning consent which had not been implemented. Whether all these schemes\\nwill be built is a matter of some doubt.\\nAgainst this background, Brindleyplace and Waterlinks - the latter with\\nabundant land supply - could have the effect of doing for Birmingham what\\nthe Rosehaugh-Stanhope-British Rail Property Board development at Broadgate\\ndid for the City of London: extend the central business district.\\nThe second common element of Brindleyplace and Waterlinks is that, although\\nthey were born in the heady days of surge in property values during the late\\n1980s, they are projects likely to come to fruition in the next cycle of the\\nproperty industry, probably during the mid- and late 1990s. But their\\nfinancing techniques reflect not the debt-led speculative development of the\\n1980s but the desire to reduce exposure of the early 1990s.\\nWaterlinks was conceived as part of a wider regeneration plan, progeny of\\nthe joint city council/private sector urban development agency which also\\nbears the name Birmingham Heartlands. It owed its origins to a belief that\\nprivate-sector expansion would make financially possible the transformation\\nof old factory areas into an office park, a belief given a fillip by the\\nfact that the companies, before the values surge, had quietly assumed\\ncontrol of up to 40 acres of land for a mere Pounds 10m.\\nBrindleyplace has always been seen as a complement to the convention centre.\\nIt was under the control of the ill-fated Merlin group, which persuaded the\\ncity council of the advantages of a development which combined the\\nonce-fashionable idea of the festival marketplace, with offices and other\\namenities such as a national aquarium, thought to be a potentially lucrative\\nnational tourist attraction.\\nMerlin moved into a joint venture with Shearwater, in the late 1980s a\\nhigh-flying Rosehaugh subsidiary specialising in retail. Merlin eventually\\nbowed out. Shearwater was absorbed in Rosehaugh, as the latter sought to\\ncontrol its finances. Rosehaugh has completed the purchase of the land from\\nthe city council for Pounds 16m and brought in the Terry Farrell partnership\\nto re-work the whole scheme.\\nThis re-working is now the subject of negotiation with the city council, but\\nRosehaugh hopes by the end of September to have in place a detailed planning\\napplication for a first phase, largely of shopping and catering facilities\\nto back up the convention centre, and an outline application for the whole\\nsite.\\nRosehaugh envisages a development built around a series of squares with 1m\\nsq ft of offices (up from the 600,000 sq ft planned by Merlin), about 50,000\\nsq ft of retail (down from the 200,000 sq ft in the Merlin scheme) plus a\\nhotel and a leisure complex. the nature of which remains the subject of\\ntalks. Rosehaugh has dropped the idea of an aquarium. So there is much for\\nthe city council to ponder.\\nWhile Rosehaugh will move into the first phase on its own account, the rest\\nof the development will be market-led. That is, if there are no customers\\nfor the office buildings they will not be built. Cash flow would be helped\\nby selling on the land for the leisure developments.\\nLikewise, Waterlinks keeps 40,000 sq ft of offices, speculatively built, as\\nstock, but will not undertake large-scale office building without a pre-let\\nor a design-and-build contract.

He\\nwill be faced by complaints from the Administration of President George Bush\\nover semiconductors, construction, auto parts and rice.\\nCongressmen will add political spice to the trip with moves of their own -\\nincluding a proposed ban on imports of Japanese rice wine to match the\\nJapanese ban on foreign rice. But all this will be a reflection of the\\npersistent underlying imbalance in trade.\\nAfter falling by more than 40 per cent since 1986, Japan's surplus is rising\\nagain. In each of the past three months, the surplus has been higher than\\nfor the same months last year. The Dollars 8.72bn surplus recorded in March\\nwas the highest since December 1988.\\nMr Paul Summerville, an economist with Jardine Fleming, the securities\\ncompany, forecasts that after falling from a peak of Dollars 90bn in 1986 to\\nDollars 54.6bn in the year to March 1991, Japan's trade surplus will rise in\\n1991-92 to Dollars 66.5bn.\\nJapanese Ministry of Finance officials deny that an upward trend is in the\\nmaking. But Miti is worried. One senior official said this week: 'We are\\nafraid this trend might continue this year. It's very important to keep the\\nsurplus under control.'\\nThe figures continue to provoke howls of protest from Washington. But, in\\ntruth, European producers have more reason to worry than Americans. While\\nthe surplus with the US fell by 11 per cent over the last year, the surplus\\nwith Europe grew by the same percentage.\\nAlso, both changes are dwarfed by the growth of the surplus with Asia which\\nsoared 47 per cent to Dollars 24.8bn - exceeding the surplus with Europe for\\nthe first time.\\nBoth short-term and long-term economic forces are at work. The Gulf crisis\\nboosted the cost of oil and gas last year - increasing Japan's fuel import\\nbill for 1990-91 by 35 per cent to Dollars 61.4bn. Now that oil prices have\\ndropped again below Dollars 20 a barrel, the cost of Japan's fuel imports\\nwill probably fall markedly in the current year - expanding the trade\\nsurplus for the next few months, though not beyond that.\\nThe recent slow-down in Japanese consumer demand will also depress imports\\nin the current year. Consumers buying luxury goods were the great force\\nbehind the expansion of imports in Japan in the late 1980s. But the turmoil\\nin Tokyo's financial markets last year is dampening appetites.\\nEuropean companies are particularly badly affected since luxuries -\\nincluding German cars, French wines and Italian jewellery - account for a\\nsignificant part of their sales in Japan. Imports from the EC rose 20.5 per\\ncent last year, but this year's increase could be much smaller. In March\\nimports were up just 0.4 per cent.\\nMr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist of Nomura Research Institute, says the\\ndecline in the growth of luxury imports is a natural result of the cyclical\\neasing in consumer demand. This is true. But it will do nothing to improve\\nJapan-EC relations at the crucial time when the community is establishing\\nnew rules for governing entry to its markets after 1992.\\nAlongside these short-term changes a significant long-term shift is taking\\nplace: Japanese exporters are successfully redirecting their energies\\ntowards Europe and Asia.\\nPolitics has played a part in this shift, with Japanese companies responding\\nto criticism from Washington. But economics has been the driving force. In\\ncomparison with the US, Europe is still an under-developed market for\\nJapanese companies. In three important countries - France, Italy and Spain\\n -severe restrictions are applied to Japanese goods.\\nAsia offers even more potential. Asia late last year overtook North America\\nas the main destination for Japanese exports. Given the high growth rate of\\nmany Asian economies, Asia's importance as a market seems certain to\\ncontinue to expand.\\nMr Summerville forecasts that by the end of the decade Asia will absorb 45\\nper cent of Japan's exports. 'For the first time in 250 years, the most\\nimportant Asian economic decisions are being made by Asian companies and\\nAsian consumers.'\\nThe long-term growth of Asia will not reverse the decline in Japan's trade\\nsurplus from its peak in the mid-1980s. But it will probably means that\\nafter increasing this year, the surplus will not fall by much in 1992 or\\nthereafter. Certainly, the surplus is unlikely to start shrinking again at\\nthe rate it did in the late 1980s. Nomura Research Institute forecasts that\\nby 1995 the trade surplus will still be Dollars 60bn.\\nThat figure may sound unacceptably high to some politicians in the US and in\\nEurope. But it could be is misleading: by 1995, the surplus will be much\\nmore equally spread among different countries. Also, the current account\\nsurplus will amount to a much smaller proportion of Japanese GNP than it did\\nat its peak in 1986. Then it was 4.5 per cent; in 1990 it was 1.2 per cent.\\nBy 1995, it could fall below 0.5 per cent.\"},\n",

On top of this, the east's machines are 'old, technically very\\nbackward, either too large or too small, too noisy, too polluting and have\\nvery low output levels'.\\nWith the world construction equipment industry's more mature western markets\\nin varying depths of recession, it is not surprising that producers are\\nmaking tracks to east Germany in a big way.\\nIt could be 10 or 20 years before some of the prospects bear fruit,\\nobservers believe. But the crane market is one of the first where words have\\nbeen matched by orders, as a result of the happy proximity - and shared\\nnationality - of the target market and the best-placed suppliers.\\nThe west German producers have a stranglehold on the old domestic market,\\nwhich over the past decade has been increasingly concentrated around the two\\nbig domestic producers, KI and Liebherr. Liebherr is technically Swiss-owned\\nbut unmistakably German in its background.\\nThe catalyst for this change has been the heavy spending required to develop\\nthe multi-axle 'all-terrain' crane, with extra large tyres, a shorter\\nchassis, and all wheels independently driven.\\nNow German producers have about 90 per cent of the worldwide all-terrain\\nmarket which they pioneered. 'We German crane fellows give each other a\\ntough time at home, and that's the engine for export growth,' says Dr\\nFrithjof Timm, KI's sales director.\\nOver the past year the all-terrain cranes have proved to be ideal for east\\nGerman conditions - especially its roads, which could more accurately be\\ndescribed as 'off-roads', Dr Timm quips.\\nA new Corporate Intelligence report estimates that 150 cranes were sold for\\nuse in east Germany last year. The enthusiastic Dr Timm puts the figure at\\n180, and says KI sold two thirds of them.\\nBy comparison, annual sales in the former West Germany stuck doggedly at\\n400-450 units between 1984 and 1988, before picking up in 1989 because of a\\nhousing boom prompted by the flood of refugees from the east.\\nThe 'east German effect' has been a godsend for KI, which has long played\\nsecond fiddle to Liebherr. In the mid-1980s the Wilhelmshaven company\\nadopted a high-volume production policy, investing heavily in new products\\nand facilities, but it is understood the crane business did not make a\\nprofit until last year.\\nAlready unification has created a domestic market with sales of 1,073 mobile\\ncrane units last year, compared with 1989 sales of 584 in the west and an\\nestimated 200 in the east.\\nBut this big increase in capacity, spurred more by confidence and tax\\nincentives than hard evidence of construction activity in the east, may be\\ntoo much for the work immediately available.\\nFor the customers operating in the east, the crucial factor in determining\\nthe success of their gamble will be funding for construction work in the\\nnext few years, and how quickly it is organised.\\nCorporate Intelligence says that, so long as work can reach a satisfactory\\nstarting level by next year, the cranes bought between 1988 and 1992 should\\nnot amount to a great excess of capacity. It warns, however, that there must\\nbe a cyclical downturn at some point after 1992, and forecasts a steady\\ndecline in the new unified market to 705 units by 1995.\\nOne forecast is rather easier: the two east German producers Babelsberg and\\nZemag will be hard pushed to sell any of their puny, antiquated\\ntruck-mounted cranes in the uplifting environment of the unified German\\nmarket.\"},\n",

As the man who first raised the threat of\\nSlovak independence last year, Mr Carnogursky can be counted on to play the\\nseparatist card, to gain greater economic aid for Slovakia.\\nHis more recent statements on the need for Slovakia to remain in the\\nCzechoslovak federation give rise to hopes in Prague that he will not\\ncompete with Mr Meciar on the incendiary issue of Slovak independence. There\\ncould be no greater contrast between the shy, ascetic-looking Mr\\nCarnogursky, who was first deputy prime minister until this week, and the\\nextrovert, bull-necked Mr Meciar, who is idolised by ordinary Slovaks.\\nMr Meciar threatened that after a month of peace for the new government he\\nwould march on Bratislava with the jobless and starving and demand to know\\nwhat the government would do for them. More than 50,000 of his supporters -\\nin the biggest demonstration in Bratislava since the communists' overthrow\\nin November 1989 - demonstrated on Wednesday evening, demanding his\\nreinstatement and hurling paving stones at parliament.\\nMr Meciar's erratic behaviour as prime minister was an important reason the\\nmain body of his Public Against Violence (PAV) movement - the Slovak\\ncounterpart of Civic Forum in Prague - joined with Mr Carnogursky to oust\\nhim.\\nMr Meciar angered the PAV leadership by forming a rival group, PAV-Platform\\nfor a Democratic Slovakia, which aims to put the brakes on the economic\\nreforms.\\nNot surprisingly, his main allies are the former communists in Slovakia who\\nregard Mr Meciar, himself a former communist youth movement functionary, as\\na guarantor of social justice.\"},\n",

(The Training\\nAgency, which has its headquarters in Sheffield, was previously the Manpower\\nServices Commission.)\\nThe Devon and Cornwall Tec consists of a main board in Plymouth and five\\narea boards (Tabs), including one for Cornwall.\\nThe Tabs also offer a business advisory service, administer enterprise\\nallowances and run a programme of business seminars.\\nThe two big employment programmes took the lion's share of spending,\\nprobably around Pounds 20m for the YTS in the last 12 months and possibly\\nPounds 11m for all the TECs.\\nSome 7,500 youngsters have been involved in the YTS administered by the\\nDevon and Cornwall Tec. Other young people from the area, including some in\\nthe Cornwall Tab area, took part in nationally administered schemes.\\nPrecise numbers of people associated with employment training are hard to\\nassess. Some people have been involved for only a few hours going along and\\nseeing what the scheme meant. However, at any given time in the last year\\nthere were probably around 5,000 tied in in some way with employment\\ntraining.\\nThis year, the Devon and Cornwall Tec has an overall budget of Pounds 49.7m,\\nof which Pounds 29.6m will be spent on young people and Pounds 9.7m on\\nadults. The rest will go on management costs, business programmes and local\\ninitiatives. Roughly two-thirds of the total will be spent in Devon and\\none-third in Cornwall.\\nThe YTS and the ET have been criticised as being too broad brush and\\ninsufficiently interested in training. They were aimed chiefly at\\nalleviating unemployment, and some employers, it is said, saw the YTS as a\\npool of obtaining cheap labour.\\nYoung people who entered the YTS complained that it was just a way of\\ndenying them unemployment benefit. By giving young people YTS money instead\\nof the dole the unemployment figures were made to look better. While there\\nwas theoretically a retraining element in the job to which they were\\ndirected, this was not always so in practice.\\nThe YTS gave way to youth training and this in turn is now being replaced by\\nanother more wideranging scheme - Training Credits. This involves the\\ncareers service office, which is part of the local education authority,\\nemployers' organisations, employers, licensed providers, approved trainers\\nand, of course, the young people themselves.\\nThe process starts when a young person goes to the careers advisory service.\\nAn action plan for work and training is then drawn up. If the youngster is\\nlucky enough to find a job straight off the employer gets together with the\\nemployee and the approved trainer to organise the job and the training and\\nthe voucher (or 'credit') is triggered. The credit can be anything from\\nPounds 1,000 to Pounds 4,500 depending on time and qualifications aimed for.\\nIf no job is immediately on offer the young person takes his action plan\\nfrom the career service to a licensed provider. This person makes an\\nassessment and transitional training is given until the right kind of job is\\nfound, and the voucher is put into effect\\nIn practice the process should be less tangled than it sounds. But there are\\nproblems.\\nSo far in Cornwall, the Tab has appointed six licensed providers and some 90\\nbodies have applied to become approved trainers. Around 30 have been\\napproved so far.\\nOne is Cornwall College, a college of further education, which has a\\nreputation for adapting to the changing needs of education. (It can also\\norganise some degrees courses in association with the Polytechnic in\\nPlymouth.)\\nIts unconventional approach is reflected in its use of a a 60 ft long bus\\nequipped with a video computer, 12-seat lecture room and some catering\\nfacilities, which physically takes the school to the pupils.\\nCornwall has a distinct pattern of unemployment. Its 10 per cent seasonally\\nadjusted rate is one of the highest rates in the country. It also has among\\nthe lowest wage rates. With the tin mining industry collapsing and English\\nChina Clays, one of the largest manufacturing concerns laying off 750\\npeople, there are particular problems among the older unemployed. The Tab is\\ntrying to address these specific problems. Approved trainers such as\\nCornwall College can help by acknowledging that the major industry is now\\ntourism, and by tailoring its courses and training accordingly.\"},\n",

Fishermen across the country are an\\nintrospective breed, little given to talking to outsiders and rarely\\ndivulging the real truth.\\nMore dispassionate observers are less gloomy, though. They point to an\\nindustry which has invested quite heavily in recent years and attracted\\nyounger men into it. They point to higher landings and the fact that Newlyn\\nis the leading port, in terms of value of fish landed, in England.\\n'Conditions are not too bad at the moment,' says Miss Elizabeth Stevenson, a\\npartner in W Stevenson and Son, the leading agent in the county which with\\n35 vessels also runs the largest privately-owned fleet in the European\\nCommunity.\\n'Quotas are reasonable and it is possible to make quite a good living.\\nConditions were difficult at the start of the year with gales restricting\\nfishing and the Gulf war pushing up fuel prices. But March was not too bad\\nfrom a fishing point of view and oil prices have come back a bit from their\\npeak. We are hopeful about the future if not over-optimistic.'\\nShe is supported by Mr Heugh Symons who with his partner Mr Steve Farrar\\nruns the Blue Sail Fish company in Looe. 'Fishing is going through a\\ndifficult time. Costs are rising all the time. Diesel, repairs, investment\\ncosts, interest rates all cost more all the time.\\n'But those who work hard, those who work long hours are those who succeed.\\nThere are people who make a good living from fishing but there are also\\nthose who are finding the going extremely tough.'\\nA similar sentiment is expressed by Mr Ian Greet, managing director of\\nFalmouth Fishselling (Falfish) in Falmouth. 'The whole industry has changed\\nover the last 10 years. Then the skippers went to sea, came back, sold their\\ncatches and went home before the cycle repeated itself.\\n'Now the whole industry is much more professional. The skipper has to be a\\nbusinessman as well as a fisherman to succeed. He has to compete against\\nsubsidised competition and the Spaniards registering as British and taking\\npart of the quotas laid down by the European Commission that would otherwise\\nhave gone to British boats. He just has to be more sophisticated to exist\\ngiven these conditions. Fortunately, he has become more sophisticated. A lot\\nmore sophisticated.'\\nIt is the role of the Spaniards, though, that is causing great concern. A\\nlarge number of Spanish vessels, having inadvisedly over-fished their own\\nwaters, have now registered in Britain and fish in Britain's traditional\\ngrounds off the south western coast. Yet they land their catches in Spain.\\n'About 95 per cent of what the Spaniards catch is landed in Spain,' Miss\\nStevenson says. 'Yet their catches are part of the British quota laid down\\nby the EEC. They are in fact catching part of our quota.'\\nThe industry is waiting to see the result of legal deliberations about this\\npractice - and it is not optimistic about the outcome. If it goes badly\\nagainst Britain then Cornwall could be hit badly and the industry suffer.\\nThere are other concerns. The European Commission has stated that the fleet\\nof the 12 member nations will have to be cut by as much as 40 per cent in\\nthe years after the opening of the single market in 1992. This comes on top\\nof an overall European reduction in capacity of 3 per cent in tonnage and 2\\nper cent in engine power in the years between 1987 and 1991.\\nEvery skipper has also had to come to terms with overfishing in the 1970s,\\nwhen the factory ships stood offshore and took almost anything that could be\\nsucked out of the sea. The setting up of a conservation box around the\\ncoasts of the south west of England drawn up to protect the fish stock,\\nespecially mackerel, was sensible but added to the pressures on boats and\\ntheir owners.\\nDespite these problems the industry is in reasonable shape. Newlyn landed\\nsome Pounds 30m of fish last year and has around 200 boats working the port.\\nLooe, a very much smaller port, has 40 boats working it and the market there\\nhandles some of the landings from nearby Mevagissey and Polperro.\\nLandings in Looe last year rose by 2 per cent to Pounds 2.248m and with the\\noverland catches, that is fish brought in to the market from Mevagissey and\\nPolperro, there was a 3.6 per cent rise to Pounds 2.799m.\\nHandling the catch has been much improved following an investment programme\\nby the harbour commissioners who were assisted by the Rural Development\\nCommission and Euro money. The auction house was rebuilt and new harbourside\\nunits put in.\\nEven with all the latest equipment on the boats as well as onshore\\nimprovements, though, a touch of luck comes in handy occasionally. Just\\nbefore Christmas some of the Looe boats struck it really lucky. Their catch\\none day turned out, to their surprise, to be bass, an upmarket fish admired\\nin Paris as well as London.\\nOne boat came in with a catch worth Pounds 64,000, enough to give them a\\nvery nice Christmas. For the port as a whole bass catches amounted to Pounds\\n850,000 last year. Had it not been for good bass catches Mr Symons says the\\nactual value of fish landed in Looe last year would have fallen slightly\\nrather than risen. Even so, the actual 2 per cent rise was lower than\\ninflation and so in real terms the port slipped slightly.\\nAround the rest of the coast there are a number of smaller ports such as\\nPadstow and Port Isaac that may have as few as half a dozen vessels based in\\nthem. Many of these will be fishing for lobster and crab, fish on which the\\nmargin of profitability is much greater.\\nDuring the season - from about now until October, depending on the weather -\\ntwo or three Vivier lorries, which have glass fibre tanks necessary to carry\\nlive shellfish, are in Cornwall every day to take the catch to continental\\nmarkets. Once their main destination was Paris but now it is Spain.\\nOverfishing has, however, cut the catch and volumes, Mr Greet believes, have\\nprobably dropped by about a half over the past five years, a symptom of the\\nchanges with which the Cornish fishermen have had contend.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-3165, TEXT: FROM the long beaches of the wild north coast to the rocky inlets and bays\\nof the south, few counties in the UK can offer the coastal variety of\\nCornwall whether interests focus on fishing out of the picturesque villages\\nlike Mevagissey and Looe on the south or surfing on the huge strands at\\nNewquay and elsewhere on the northern shore, or building sandcastles or\\nwalking along the rugged cliffs.\\nThe Scilly Islands in the far west also attract great attention. It takes\\ntwo hours to reach them by boat from Penzance; 15 minutes by fixed wing\\naircraft; and 22 minutes by helicopter. Inland there is the beautiful Bodmin\\nMoor, and lots of other stunning scenery.\\nAccordingly, Cornwall remains one of the favourite holiday spots in Britain.\\nA plan drawn up for the Tourism Action Plan Programme estimates that with\\nmore than 3m visitors Cornwall in 1989 was the seventh busiest holiday\\ncounty in England in terms of holiday trips, second after Devon for numbers\\nof holiday nights; and third largest recipient of holiday spending after\\nDevon and London.\\nFollowing the collapse of tin mining and other manufacturing activities,\\ntourism is Cornwall's most important industry. A University of Bradford\\nstudy undertaken in 1987 reckoned it accounted for 33,042 jobs and the\\nBritish Tourist Authority in 1986 put the number at 33,603. This is about 21\\nper cent of all jobs in Cornwall, more than twice the level estimated to be\\nemployed in the tourism industry in Devon. More than half these jobs were\\nfull time.\\nIn 1989, total tourism expenditure was put at Pounds 585m by the English\\nTourist Board. In addition to hotel bills, this included cash spent in shops\\nand restaurants, on self-catering and ancillary professional services.\\nIn spite of the apparent buoyancy, however, all is not entirely well.\\nCornwall clearly continues to attract lots of visitors. For example, almost\\none third of all holiday makers are perennial returners. Almost one third\\nalso go to Newquay. These are predominantly young people for its night life\\nas well as its go long beach.\\nBut historically the industry has been in decline. At the end of the 1970s\\nthere were nearly 4m visitors and Pounds 350m was spent in 1979. . Given\\ninflation and the more restricted criteria on which spending was calculated\\nthis was probably per capita more than today.\\nThe reasons for the decline, also found in other British resorts, are that\\nthe advent of the package tour to the Costa Del Sol replaced the British old\\nstyle, long-stay, bucket and spade summer holiday. People turned to Europe\\nand beyond.\\nPartly to arrest the trend long-a three year Tourism Development Action\\nProgramme was set up in 1989 to look at the possibilities.\\nA joint venture of the English Tourist Board and the local authorities and\\ntourism organisations, the TDAP, found that while long holidays are not\\ngenerally increasing in numbers and value, other types of tourism are.\\nCornwall still has an average length of stay of seven days, longer than in\\nwhich is long compared to south-east coastal resorts such as Brighton and\\nBournemouth.\\nThe TDAP set out to develop short breaks and business tourism markets to\\nencourage more visitors to stay and develop business outside of the main\\nseason. It has attempted to improve, grade, develop and market accommodation\\nthe visitor needs. It has tried to improve tourist information centres, and\\nsign-posting to target the wealth of heritage centres, not just ancient\\ncastles, fine old houses and maritime centres but also industrial museums\\nand artefacts.\\nIt has helped to establish the Cornwall Creative Network which has\\nidentified 136 different kinds of specialist holidays which can be taken in\\nCornwall. They range from fishing and bird watching to brass rubbing, flower\\ncollecting and Cornish language courses.\\nSome developments have taken place independently, such as the upgrading of\\nLand's End by one of Mr Peter de Savary's companies. According to one of Mr\\nde Savary's colleagues, when the group bought the 120 acres of Land's End in\\n1987 for Pounds 7m it was virtually derelict and cliff erosion made many of\\nthe walks unsafe. It has spent Pounds 4m on shoring up the cliffs,\\nrefurbishing the hotel and building a heritage centre.\\nLand's End still attracts 700,000 visitors a year, its previous total. . But\\nwhile they used to stay only eight minutes, during which they might buy\\nlittle more than a postcard, they now stay for nearly three hours and spend\\nPounds 6 per head.\\nAnother example of value being added to tourism is at Falmouth, where Mr De\\nSavary has built a marina and flats.\\nThe most striking development, however, has been in the growth of\\nself-catering holidays. These are no longer taken in the old-style post\\nsecond world war prefabs or parked caravans, but in cottages and houses\\nbought as investments and/or second homes. They are usually renovated to a\\nhigh standard. Because of tax concessions some businesses have bought groups\\nof them, which are managed by agencies.\\nBut even a single cottage owner can run it as a business and set all costs\\nagainst income (even interest on loans to buy it) and avoid capital gains\\ntax until retirement.\\nThe conditions are that the house be let for at least 140 days a year and\\nthat no single tenancy should exceed 31 days in any seven months.\\nAs a result of the mushrooming of these houses and cottages, 60 per cent of\\nall holidays in Cornwall are now taken in self-catering units and the season\\nhas been lengthened.\\nThe self-catering holidays have become equally controversial for a different\\nreason. Local people do not like outsiders bidding up property prices\\nthereby putting them beyond the reach of young residents.\\nAlthough Cornwall's tourism is changing and the decline appears to have been\\narrested , through self catering and the growth of foreign and other\\nvisitors, it has not been without cost in some Cornish eyes.\"},\n",

The docks, a member of\\nthe A & P Appledore group, is part of traditional Cornish industry - not\\nperhaps as famous as mining but every bit as traditional. Small boat\\nbuilding and an associated repair sector is to be found at many ports around\\nthe long coastline; Falmouth docks differs only in that it is large.\\nIt has been larger. Today the company employs just over 550 people, a number\\nthat rises to nearer 800 when casuals - workers taken on for perhaps a week\\nor two at a time to supplement the permanent staff - are included.\\nTogether with the other tenant companies on the docks, such as Falmouth Oil\\nServices and Pendennis Ship Yard, more than 1,000 are employed within the\\nyard which is the most important single contributor to the economy of the\\ntown.\\nOnce, it was not only bigger but much bigger. Mr Tom Duncan, Appledore's\\nchief executive in Falmouth, was not there at the time but he recalls that\\nthe ship repair side alone once employed more than 2,000 men. He also\\nrecalls that British Shipbuilders, who owned it in the early 1980s, ran down\\nthe number to about 75 and wanted to close a port that is a major harbour on\\nthe shipping lanes. Since his arrival in 1985 he has built the operation\\nback to the point where it has a turnover of about Pounds 20m. a year.\\nEven more traditional than dockyards within the Cornish industrial sector,\\nthough, is mining. Tin is as linked with Cornwall as whisky with Scotland or\\nshipbuilding with Tyneside. Most of the great tin names such as Wheal Jane\\nhave now disappeared although some processing continues at South Crofty,\\nnear Redruth.\\nIt is at St Austell, though, that the mining industry continues to exist in\\nstrength and profitability. There, the end product is china clay, or kaolin\\nas it is known overseas.\\nMr Graham Lovering, managing director of the company's mineral operations,\\nheads the most important single employer in the county with some 4,000\\nworkers.\\nECC produces some 3m tons of clay a year and is meeting demand rising by 2-3\\nper cent a year.

That switch will not\\ninvolve more than 30 staff but is an erosion of decision making out of the\\ncounty, a trend that has occurred in other parts of Britain.\\nAt least the restructuring of ECC and Appledore has produced viable\\ncompanies. Elsewhere in the county there has been a distressing catalogue of\\nclosures, especially in engineering.\\nCompanies such as Case, Strategic Alloys and Bryants Electrical have shut\\ndown or moved out of the county turning the Redruth-Camborne area in\\nparticular into an economic black spot.\\nHowever, bodies such as the Devon and Cornwall Development Bureau, which is\\nthe county's inward-investment arm under its director Mr Ivor Simpson, and\\nthe Devon and Cornwall Development Company, which co-ordinates the private\\nand public sectors under Mr John Caff, have been instrumental along with the\\nCornwall Economic Development Office, a county council-led body under Mr\\nJohn Rees-Evans, in switching the emphasis towards lighter, more\\nhigh-technology industry.\\nThis switch compensates for Cornwall's distance from markets since the\\nend-products of the incomers are not nearly as sensitive to transport costs.\\nA survey undertaken by Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte for Mr Simpson's Bureau\\nhas forecast the electronics sector to grow strongly over the next three\\nyears.\\nMr Ivor Simpson says that major investment is highly likely to be undertaken\\nin the region with two companies 'planning to invest more than Pounds 20m\\nand four planning to invest more than Pounds 5m.\\n'The evidence contained in the survey should have a galvanising effect on\\ncompanies looking to set up European operations to take advantage of the\\nsingle European market after 1992.'\\nThe larger part of the growth of electronics has taken place in Devon but\\ncompanies such as BT International and Fitzgerald Light and the Goonhilly\\ntelecommunications station on the Lizard peninsula have shown it is possible\\nto create a high-tech industry in the county.\\nA further development has been the growth of food processing, led by people\\nsuch as Ginsters, which now operates a national distribution chain from its\\nheadquarters at Callington, near Liskeard, and Rodda, the ice-cream\\nproducer, at Scorrier, between Redruth and Truro.\\nFood and drink as a sector provided work last year for 4,180 people\\naccording to figures produced for Mr Mike Jordan and Mr Peter Fitzgerald of\\nCornwall TAB - almost double the number three years earlier.\\nMr Caff believes that 'what is still needed is a broader and realistic\\npublic consensus of what can be done and what needs to be done'.\\nGiven that consensus he sees no need to be anything other than optimistic\\nabout the county's industrial future.\"},\n",

The private sector is very cautious, he adds. It wants pre-lets\\nwhere possible.\\nEven so, a number of small privately-owned business parks can be found\\ndotted around the county - at Launceston, Wadebridge and Bodmin, for\\ninstance. English Estates itself has 30,000sq ft in Falmouth and a much\\nsmaller, 6,000sq ft development in Liskeard. But business parks in general\\nhave been slow to develop reliable roots in the county compared with other\\nareas of Britain.\\nOf the 500 properties in the duchy belonging to English Estates a large\\nnumber were put up in the 1980s. When the upturn in the economy comes it\\nwill, therefore be well positioned to cater for demand, especially in the\\nsmaller units up to about 1,500sq ft where the casualty list has been\\nheaviest.\\nThe situation in the industrial market is reflected to a very large extent\\nin the office and retail sectors according to Mr Steve Lobb, partner in\\nChesterton's Plymouth office. 'The only place in the county that can sustain\\nspeculative office development is Truro,' he says. 'The county town is also\\nabout the only place where a healthy demand for retail outlets exists.'\\nTruro stands out in these two sectors. Office rents have reached Pounds\\n12.50-13 a sq ft in the city which Mr Lobb describes as 'pretty remarkable'.\\nAlthough prices have softened a little this year Maybey Developments South\\nWest has let the whole of Elizabeth House to the Employment Services Agency\\nin the region of Pounds 12-13 a sq ft according to Mr Lobb.\\nAnother government arm, the Inland Revenue, has bought the freehold of a\\n45,000sq ft block for Pounds 6.1m but the county's main problem is there is\\nno investment market so that deals tend to be one-off.\\nElsewhere, Sun Alliance has had a scheme on the stocks for some time in\\nTruro in which Debenhams would be the anchor store and rents generally\\napproach Pounds 80 a sq ft for zone A properties. This compares with Pounds\\n40 in St Austell, Falmouth and Penzance and even lower in Newquay.\\nIn St Austell, Guinea Properties had a Pounds 30m scheme for Aylmer Square\\nbut that is understood to have been sold on to Sovereign Land which is\\nbelieved to be looking at a more modest scheme.\\nThe retail sector is slightly more healthy and although most of the activity\\nhas again been centred on Truro there are signs that some of the bigger food\\nchains are now looking more widely around the county. Sainsbury's decision\\nto build on the old county hall site in Truro is considered a watershed\\nwithin the market because it brings in one of the top groups.\\nSainsbury is also thought to be looking at both St Austell and Falmouth.\\nIt is in the far west of the county that the greatest difficulty arises in\\ndeveloping properties, according to English Estates' senior development\\nsurveyor Mr Tony Thomson. The Redruth-Camborne axis in particular has had a\\nvery difficult time over the past year. A number of companies such as Case,\\nStrategic Alloys, Bryants Electrical and B & J Shoes have pulled out and\\nfilling the factories is made all the more difficult, he claims, because the\\nlocal authority, Kerrier, only wants manufacturing industry on sites in the\\narea.\\nMr Thomson believes that if it were possible to open up the market to\\ndistribution concerns it might be possible both to fill some of the\\nfactories and create jobs in an area of high unemployment. 'Rents certainly\\nbecome cheaper the further west into the county one goes, which should help\\nus when the market picks up,' he adds. At the moment industrial units\\nattract about Pounds 3 a sq ft for those over 10,000sq ft rising to about\\nPounds 6 for micro units of about 500 sq ft, though English Estates\\nintroduces an element of charging what the market will bear by charging\\nslightly less for small rural properties.\"},\n",

But the A 30, the main spine road\\nthrough Cornwall, is dual carriageway for all but 30 miles of its length.\\nMost of the towns and villages that were once bottlenecks now have\\nby-passes.\\nThe drive to London, with stops, takes around six hours. That is still a\\nlong time to small children but for businessmen it means only a moderate\\nextra cost.\\nA lorry leaving at night can reach Felixstowe or other east coast ports\\ncomfortably in eight hours. This is the maximum time that the tachograph\\n(the so-called spy in the cab) permits a driver to stay on the road. He can\\nthen rest during the ferry crossing. Once on the continent, he can drive for\\nanother eight hours by when he is in reach of most important north European\\nplaces.\\nMr Robertson's Development Office recommends that businesses take this route\\nrather than the westerly crossings from Plymouth to Roscoff in France or\\nSantander in Spain, which are far from the main European centres.\\nThe additional cost is only marginal since many cargoes are gauged by weight\\nrather than by distance. Some large hauliers such as TNT and Securicor have\\nset up in Cornwall because of the new businesses which settled there.\\nPreviously they handled their Cornish business from Plymouth or Bristol.\\nFor high value, low volume operations such as electronics or service\\ncompanies, Cornwall's location does not necessarily mean greater expense.\\nMany such of companies were formed before recession struck in 1990. But\\nthere are also large food companies which find it economic to import food\\nfrom Europe, process it in Cornwall and distribute it throughout Britain.\\nAny extra geographical costs can be offset by savings elsewhere.\\nThen there is the question of what kind of managerial skills exist there.\\nMany entrepreneurs have moved their small businesses to Cornwall because of\\nthe quality of life offers their families. But they still needed to keep in\\ntouch with London, and of it still takes four and a half hours by rail from\\nPaddington to Truro, the duchy's administrative capital, a little too long\\nfor for frequent day trips.\\nUntil recently the answer lay with Brymon Airways, the small airline 40 per\\ncent owned by British Airways and 40 per cent by the Danish Group Maersk.\\nEquipped with five executive style Dash-7 aircraft, it offers four flight a\\nday from Newquay to Heathrow.\\nThe flight takes an hour and the fare is comparable with a first class\\nticket on the British Rail. It actually costs more than the Pounds 66 for a\\nfirst class ticket from Paddington to Truro, but there is a complimentary\\nbreakfast and a complimentary bar so the price works out roughly the same.\\nThe return flight from Heathrow to Newquay touches down at Plymouth. In the\\nyear to March, the airline carried 75,000 passengers on this route. It has\\nother routes but because of recession and the Gulf war, which hit most\\nairlines, Brymon had a very bad year. It expects a pre-tax loss of Pounds\\n1.3m for its last financial year on a turnover of Pounds 30m.\\nUsually, however, the Newquay to Heathrow route is very successful. The\\nDash-7s fly at 68 per cent capacity and more than 90 per cent of the\\npassengers are business people.\\nHowever, Brymon is worried by the decision of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the\\nSecretary of State for Transport, to take the advice of the Civil Aviation\\nAuthority and throw open Heathrow to new scheduled and charter operators.\\nRegional airlines such as Brymon have been told they will retain landing\\nrights at Heathrow. But Brymon is concerned over an earlier statement by the\\nBritish Airports Authority, owner of Heathrow, that 'if there is any major\\nrelaxation (of access to Heathrow), we may need to respond with pricing\\nfactors, involving higher Heathrow charges'.\\nMr Malcolm Naylor, managing director of Brymon, says 'any self respecting\\nsupplier of a monopoly product with unsatisfied demand would do the same'.\\nHowever, Brymon's fees at Heathrow have risen 120 per cent in the past five\\nyears and account for one third of revenue on this route. The airline does\\nnot expect to be physically ejected from Heathrow but Mr Naylor fears it\\ncould be priced out.\\n'It has got to be Heathrow. Around 75 per cent of our passengers fly on from\\nthere to other destinations in the US and the Far East. Stansted and Gatwick\\njust are no good for our needs', Mr Naylor says.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-3169, TEXT: IT IS one of the great certainties of the British summer that once more the\\nholidaymakers will flock down the M 5 motorway this year into Cornwall. The\\nduchy, with its incomparable beaches, magnificent surf, cream teas and warm\\nweather, is just about everything the average holidaymaker wants from the\\nannual break. Two fine hot summers in succession have brought back the\\nattractions of British resorts generally and Cornwall confidently expects a\\nbumper time especially following the Gulf war, the collapse of companies\\ncatering for the Costas trade and the rise in package-holiday prices.\\nSome 3.5m people visit Cornwall every year and the indications are this\\nnumber will be topped before autumn arrives and the deck chairs are stacked\\naway, the last ice-cream consumed, the oars put away on the boats taking\\ntrippers around the bay.\\nWhat few of the trippers will see, though, is a county in transition, one\\nthat has been badly affected economically and searching, not without\\nsuccess, for a more diversified economy. 'Cornwall has been hard hit by the\\nrecession,' says Mr John Caff, director of the Devon and Cornwall\\nDevelopment Company. 'A broad and realistic consensus of what can be done\\nand what needs to be done is now essential if it is to realise its\\npotential.'\\nMr John Rees-Evans, the county's economic planning officer, goes a stage\\nfurther. 'Cornwall continues to be biased towards the primary industries and\\ntourism but there is a very positive trend towards a more balanced economy,'\\nhe states. 'Growth is coming from manufacturing and financial services.'\\nThe two agree that reducing dependence on traditional industries such as tin\\nmining, fishing, agriculture and engineering will be made easier by the\\nincreased emphasis being placed on what Mr Caff calls the 'quality of life'\\nfactor.\\n'Until the late 1980s,' says Mr Rees-Evans, 'industry was all about the\\ncompany. Now it is increasingly about where that company exists. This is\\nwhere Cornwall will score because the quality of life here is far superior\\nto that in most of the rest of Britain. This will allow us to attract the\\nnew companies that want a clean environment and a good workforce.' And Mr\\nJohn Berry, managing director of the Cornwall Enterprise Board, adds that\\nthe county is 'a serious place from which to do business. It's as cheap to\\nexport from here in small parcels as anywhere else in the country.'\\nCornwall's economy is characterised by small firms, low pay, high\\nunemployment and, because of its dependence on tourism, a seasonal nature to\\nthe work available.\\nUnemployment is significantly higher than in the rest of the UK. In January,\\nthe figure was 10 per cent against a British average of 6.7 per cent and 6.1\\nper cent for the south west as a whole. The figure has been sustained by\\nclosures in the Camborne-Redruth area which have turned this part of the\\ncounty into a black spot, by ECC International cutting its job force in St\\nAustell by 750 and several smaller job losses. The nearby Saltash area, too,\\nhas been affected by the run-down in numbers in Devonport dockyard.\\nSome 90 per cent of the businesses in the duchy employ fewer than 25 people,\\nthe sort of concern that Mr Richard Goldring of English Estates describes as\\nbeing in the forefront of the recession.\\nBetween 1984 and 1987, the last year for which figures are available, the\\nnumbers in agriculture and fishing dropped by 6.2 per cent, in mining by\\n33.7 per cent and in construction by 8.4 per cent, all significantly above\\nthe national average. Mr Rees-Evans believes the trends contained within\\nthese figures have continued.\\nAccording to the 1990 New Earnings Survey from the Department of Employment,\\nmen's wages in Cornwall averaged Pounds 241.90 a week last year, 81.8 per\\ncent of the British average and 87.2 per cent of that of the south west\\ngenerally. Earnings for women, at Pounds 166.80 a week, showed a similar\\ndiscrepancy and the earnings figures were the lowest for any county in\\nBritain.\\nThese bleak figures, though, do not show the way in which Cornwall has been\\nadapting. If tin mining has disappeared, there remains a buoyant china clay\\nindustry. Fishing is producing a good income for its skippers and crew and\\nthe efforts to diversify the economy have been successful.\\nBanking, finance and insurance as a sector grew by 24.6 per cent between\\n1984 and 1987 against a national average of 16 per cent and others to\\noutperform the British figure were distribution, tourism, transport,\\nprinting, communications and 'other manufacturing and services', which\\nincludes the food industry. Newquay Steam Beer, Ginsters' Cornish pasties\\nand Rodda's ice cream have won national markets. 'We have been able to\\nattract new companies,' says CEDO's Mr John Rees-Evans, 'through having a\\ngood workforce, a pool of trainable labour and low absenteeism rates.'\\nThe county also has a growing population. Numbers rose throughout the 1980s\\nand look set to continue to do so, despite the falling school rolls, until\\nthe next century. The present population of 450,000 is expected to grow to\\n500,000 by the year 2001 and a decade later it could be up to 650,000.\\nUnlike counties such as Dorset or Sussex, and despite popular\\nmisconceptions, this growth is not coming from pensioners looking to move\\ninto the county at the end of their working lives. The growth is coming from\\neconomically mobile and active people who want to live and work in a clean\\nenvironment.\\nBetween 1981 and 1989 there was a net increase of 34,000 jobs to absorb the\\ngrowing population and Mr Rees Evans says between 1984 and 1987 'we were,\\nand we believe we continue to be, more successful than the rest of the\\ncountry in creating jobs in manufacturing. We boosted employment in this\\narea by 3.4 per cent at a time when Britain, climbing out of the depression,\\ndropped by 4.7 per cent. We are having to create around 3,000 net new jobs a\\nyear just to meet population growth.'\\nIf Cornwall is to take full advantage of this growth then it needs to\\nimprove its infrastructure. The word 'infrastructure' normally conjures up\\nthoughts of roads and while improvements are necessary it is equally\\nimportant to update water supply, sewage treatment and disposal, recycling\\nfacilities and development sites.\\nRoads, though, are crucial. Cornwall is one of the few English counties\\nwithout an inch of motorway. Its most important spine road, the A 30, will\\nhave dual carriageway by the mid-1990s but, as Mr Graham Lovering, managing\\ndirector of ECC International, points out, one vital road is not sufficient.\\n'Roads into and out of the county have improved enormously', he says. 'But\\nthere are still too many businesses within the county that have to use what\\nare little more than country lanes to get their goods to market. Taking clay\\nfrom our 35 pits in the county, and we produce 3m tons a year, to port in\\nFowey or Par means travelling along narrow, country roads. It would help\\nenormously if these were upgraded, too.'\\nOther links are important. British Rail has just brought forward the last\\ntrain of the day from Paddington into Cornwall and there is resentment that\\nmost of the fast services end in Plymouth. There is concern that Brymon\\nAirways' flights from Newquay might be squeezed out of London's Heathrow.\\nGreater use of Falmouth as a port would be welcomed - though here\\nintroduction of a Ro-Ro facility is a possibility.\\nTo minimise the economic disadvantages of distance from markets Cornwall has\\njoined the Atlantic Arc, a grouping of areas on the geographical perimeter\\nof the European Community. Cornwall College and the county's chamber of\\nindustry have established links with mainland Europe and tourism links have\\nbeen encouraged with Brittany, northern Spain, Portugal and southern\\nIreland.\\nTwo weeks ago, work began on converting an old gasworks in St Ives into an\\noutpost of London's Tate gallery. St Ives, with its incomparable bay, was\\nthe home of Barbara Hepworth and a host of other artists and the gallery\\nwill contain 80 of the Tate's collection of 300 works by the St Ives school.\\nThe Pounds 2.75m project is among a number of new investments within the\\nvitally-important tourism sector. Mr Peter de Savary's Land's End project\\nand housing schemes at Falmouth and Hayle may have caught the eye but just\\nas important has been the golf-course-and-housing development at St Mellion\\nand hotel improvements at St Martin's on the Scilly Isles, Talland Bay,\\nbetween Looe and Polperro, and St Keyne.\\nCornwall may be looking to new niche industries to transform its industrial\\neconomy but it is not ignoring those activities which, however\\nunquantifiable, have added immeasurably to the richness of its character.\"},\n",

It would then sell up to half the\\nshares in the new company, raising up to Pounds 250m in the process.\\nBeazer would be left owning a large US aggregate, cement and concrete\\nbusiness, as well as a bare majority interest in a separately quoted company\\nholding its UK and other European operations.\\nThe funds would be used to reduce the group's large US borrowings, most of\\nwhich were raised to support the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1bn) acquisition of\\nthe Koppers cement and aggregates business in 1988.\\nMr Beazer put a brave face on things yesterday: 'Our primary duty is to\\nmaximise the return for our shareholders. We believe our proposals will do\\nthat and raise cash at the same time.'\\nThey mean, however, that Beazer's strategy of building a transatlantic\\nbusiness, based on property and contracting in the UK and building materials\\nin the US, has come off the rails. No matter what gloss the directors put on\\nthe proposal, they would not be planning it unless they had been forced to\\ndo so by an overriding need to raise cash and reduce the strain on Beazer's\\nbalance sheet.\\nThe group's last annual accounts, for the year to June 30 1990, showed net\\ndebts of Pounds 880.5m, compared with shareholders' funds of just over\\nPounds 1bn. Debt has fallen since then. However, interest payments of Pounds\\n40m during the six months to the end of December were only twice covered by\\noperating profits of Pounds 80m.\\nInterest cover could reduce further during the six months to June 30, the\\nend of Beazer's financial year. Other UK housebuilders have warned that\\nprofits will fall steeply during the first six months of this year. Profits\\nin the US may also have declined.\\nBeazer has had a meteoric rise. It has grown from a Bath-based housebuilder\\nwith turnover of less than Pounds 20m in 1979 into a multinational business\\nwith annual sales in 1989-90 of more than Pounds 2bn. Beazer is Britain's\\nfourth-largest housebuilder and the second-largest aggregates producer in\\nthe US.\\nIt achieved this status through a rapid series of acquisitions, financed in\\nthe mid-1980s through the issue of large amounts of Beazer paper. Between\\n1983  - when Brian Beazer became chairman and chief executive  - and 1988,\\nthe number of shares issued by the company rose from 12m to 300m.\\nBy the mid-1980s investors had become disenchanted with the amount of paper\\nbeing issued. A Pounds 183m rights issue by Beazer in the autumn of 1986, to\\nsupport the acquisition of Gifford Hill, the US cement group, was less than\\nthree-quarters subscribed.\\nBeazer had little choice, therefore, but to finance the purchase of Koppers\\nthrough debt  - initially in partnership with a consortium of bankers led by\\nShearson Lehman of the US and National Westminster of the UK. Beazer\\nsubsequently bought out the interests of its partners, taking all of the\\ndebt for Koppers on to its own balance sheet.\\nBorrowings remain uncomfortably high, despite the sale of the Koppers\\nchemicals business and disposals of some of the Gifford Hill cement\\nbusinesses. The group has forecast that net debt will fall to about Pounds\\n750m by the end of June  - equivalent to about three-quarters of\\nshareholders' funds.\\nThe group's options to reduce borrowings are constrained. It is doubtful\\nwhether a rights issue could succeed given the company's current financial\\nposition. UK shareholders  - familiar with the company's previous record on\\nissuing paper  - might be reluctant to support such a move. There would also\\nbe technical difficulties in calling on support from US investors, who\\naccount for between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of Beazer's shares.\\nThe alternatives, therefore, are to sell hard assets in weak construction\\nmarkets in both the UK and US, or to offer minority stakes in one of the\\ngroup's main businesses.\\nA year ago Beazer raised the prospect of floating off parts of its US\\noperations, including Koppers. This idea has clearly been found wanting. For\\na start, the group would be trying to sell a stake in a business with large\\namounts of debt. The UK operations, by comparison, are currently very\\nlightly borrowed.\\nA price for Koppers might also be reduced by fears of possible future claims\\nfor environmental damage. The claims could arise from Koppers' former\\nownership of the chemical business for which Beazer has already made\\nprovisions of Pounds 300m.\\nThe sale of a stake in the UK business is probably the least undesirable\\noption considering that the group needs badly to reduce its debts. A sale\\nonly to existing shareholders would be the equivalent of a rights issue,\\nanyway.

There has\\nnever been any criticism of the underlying quality of the businesses bought\\nby Beazer.\\nThe problem has been that the company has been unable to deliver the returns\\nnecessary to justify the level of debt raised to acquire the new operations.\"},\n",

KPMG monitors new\\nissues on both the USM and the stock exchange's official list.\\nNew-issue activity on both markets was severely depressed during the\\nquarter, largely due to the UK recession and uncertainties after the Gulf\\nwar.\\nThe statistics also revealed a new low in the steady, steep decline of\\ncompanies seeking a USM quotation. The junior market, founded in November\\n1980, was once a bustling arena for the small and growing company.\\nLast year, the number of new issues was 47, raising a total of Pounds 40m\\nworth of new money, down from 87 raising Pounds 303m in 1988.\\nSome followers of the USM are concerned that its relative decline will\\ncontinue, even when investor appetite for new issues improves. Changes in\\nstock exchange regulations have made it easier for companies to go straight\\nto the official list.\\nThe first-quarter statistics continue last year's trend. KPMG said the USM\\nlast year suffered a net shrinkage as 29 of its constituent companies moved\\nup to the main market.\\nThe figures show that the main market saw 12 new entrants. Three of these\\nwere investment trusts which raised funds when they floated. But all nine\\ncompanies joining the market came by way of introduction, where a listing is\\nobtained without shares being simultaneously sold.\\nThe investment trusts raised a total of Pounds 90m in the first quarter. New\\nentrants to the main market in 1990 raised Pounds 899m.\\nThe comparative figures exclude privatisations, including this spring's\\nflotation of National Power and PowerGen, the two electricity generators.\\nMeanwhile, five companies obtained a USM quotation during the first three\\nmonths  - the lowest-ever quarterly total. All of these were introductions\\nand three were transfers from the Third Market  - the arena for the very\\nsmallest and youngest companies which was abolished at the beginning of the\\nyear.\\nSix of the companies introduced to the official list came from the USM.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-3185, TEXT: IT is not hard to see why John Major wants to avoid postponing the general\\nelection until 1992. The charge of ditherer might stick. The winter and\\nspring would be dominated by messy legislation to introduce the council tax.\\nEurope could yet re-emerge as a dangerously divisive issue. Then, of course,\\nthere is the unpredictable.\\nSo the emerging consensus in the cabinet is that Mr Major will seek his\\nmandate in the Autumn. Some ministers are convinced there is a chance still\\nof a late June election. With the poll tax cauterised, they argue, the\\nTories might yet do well in the May 2 local elections. If they then held\\nMonmouth in the by-election two weeks later, the stage could be set to\\nsecure a 50-seat Westminster majority before the voters departed for the\\nCosta del Sol.\\nFor most though, October or November looks by far the stronger bet. The\\nTreasury judgment is that the promise of better times ahead is not enough.\\nThe electorate needs to feel the benefit of lower inflation and mortgage\\nrates for a few months before they will forgive the government its past\\neconomic sins.\\nUnemployment will get a lot worse before it even starts to get better. Many\\nC2 voters whose mood will determine the election have already decided that\\nthis year they will have to forsake Benidorm for Bognor. There is still a\\nlobby in Great George Street for 1992.\\nThat said, the mood in the Cabinet is remarkably buoyant  - at times almost\\ncomplacent. It is partly because his colleagues like Mr Major's style. To\\nsome, cabinet government may look like dithering; to insiders it is what one\\nlikes to refer to as a 'gale of fresh air.' If polls are a guide, the voters\\nagree.\\nMinisters believe the government has absorbed not only everything it has\\nthrown at itself but also the best Labour can muster. The parties are neck\\nand neck now, but every extra point off mortgage rates should put two or\\nthree points on the Tories' rating.\\nThere is another reason why the prime minister will want to avoid soldiering\\non until the bitter end. It is invariably overlooked.\\nThe approaching public spending round is about to provide the first real\\ntest of 'Majorism'. It will tell us whether he can, as promised, be tougher\\nthan Mrs Thatcher on inflation, still deliver tax cuts, and yet give the\\npublic sector enough money to provide a decent standard of services.\\nHe could not have chosen a tougher year to try to square the circle. The\\ndetailed figures, as always, are obscure, the more so because the switch\\nfrom local taxation to VAT has distorted the Treasury's cash planning\\ntotals.\\nBut the bottom line could not be more painfully clear. The rising\\nunemployment which comes with economic recession alongside public sector\\nwage deals reflecting last year's rather than this year's inflation rates\\nhave wiped out most of the real growth built into the 1990 public spending\\nsettlement.\\nThe latest spending round  - its start has just been signalled by a lengthy\\nand gloomy Treasury sent to all the main spending departments - will be even\\ntougher than the last.\\nPublic sector pay settlements averaging 8 per cent have bitten deeply into\\nthe Treasury's contingency reserve for the current financial year. So too\\nhas the sharp rise in unemployment, the Budget concession on child benefit\\nand a commitment to spend more on training.\\nInflation in 1992 will be lower, but every extra pound spent this year\\nraises the base lines on which spending ministers predicate their bids for\\nextra cash in 1992/93.\\nAt the department of health Mr William Waldegrave, can argue that his cash\\nallocation for next year implies at best a freeze and at worst a real cut in\\nNHS spending. With the NHS reforms likely to make cash shortages more\\ntransparent, we can expect him to bid for an extra Pounds 2bn or so.\\nMr Kenneth Clarke, never shy about asking for an extra several billion will\\nmake a similar case at education. Mr Major has promised after all to raise\\nthe status (that means pay) of career teachers. On the most optimistic\\nassumptions Mr Michael Heseltine will need Pounds 1.5bn to prevent the final\\nyear of the poll tax from turning 1992 into the final year of the\\ngovernment. It is not difficult to double that.\\nBack at the Treasury Mr Norman Lamont is looking at a forecast Pounds 8bn\\nbudget deficit which already looks optimistic. And he would, as he reminded\\nus the ther day, at least make a start on cutting taxes.\\nIt is the sort of circle that Mr Major would do best to try squaring after\\nand not before a general election.\"},\n",

They pointed\\nout that several brokers had already written in the Merrill forecasts. They\\nsaid that nerves ahead of the annual meeting were to be expected, given the\\nstop-start prospects for the company's new trading products since last\\nsummer.\\nThey conceded, however, that with much of the trading in the stock being\\nconducted in New York, a downgrading from a US broker would have significant\\ninfluence.\\nReuters dropped 50 at one point before ending at 823p, a net decline of 42.\\nTrading was heavy for the stock, with 3.3m shares changing hands.\\nECC weakens\\nTwo apparently ill-conceived market stories took the spice out of the shares\\nof ECC, the industrial materials group, yesterday. After outperforming the\\nrest of the sector for the past month, the shares reacted nervously on hints\\nboth of a rights issue and that a large line of stock was on offer. The\\nshares fell to 407p before closing 15 down on balance at 410p.\\nThe rights issue speculation probably stemmed from the group's announced\\nintention to replace some short-term debt. ECC said last year, when\\nacquiring Georgia Kaolin, that part of the three-year multi-currency credit\\nfacility of up to Dollars 600m necessary to fin-ance the deal would in due\\ncourse be put on a longer term basis in international capital markets.\\nECC said it did not intend that such funding would be the subject of a\\nrights issue and, according to finance director Mr Robert Carlton-Porter\\nyesterday, that position has not changed.\\nInvestigation into the stock-on-offer report revealed the presence of an\\neager seller but not in the million-plus quantities suggested by the talk.\\nCadbury Schweppes fell 10 to 370p as speculation continued that it was about\\nto issue a Pounds 400m convertible bond to fund a takeover of Dr\\nPepper/7-up, the US soft drinks company. The shares refused to recover in\\nspite of the company once again ruling out any rights or bond issue.\\nAsda was a penny lower at 121p on turnover of 4.6m as the market waited for\\nthe company's meetings with brokers which begin today. There has been\\nwidespread speculation that brokers will lower their forecasts after the\\nmeetings.\\nArgyll dipped 3 to 300p after reports that analysts at some leading\\ninvestment institutions had visited the company, while Unilever shed 3 to\\n758p ahead of its quarterly figures expected on May 17.\\nSG Warburg added its voice to the chorus of analysts saying that Glaxo\\nshould be bought. Warburg, the company's broker, published a comprehensive\\nreview of Glaxo's products. It was particularly positive on asthma\\ntreatments, where it said that within five years revenues should exceed\\nthose from Glaxo's best selling Zantac drug.\\nSmithKline Beecham continued to suffer from recent 'take profits' advice.\\nThe shares briefly dipped below Pounds 8 before ending at 807p, a net 10\\neasier.\\nICI weakened again in nervous trading ahead of today's first-quarter\\nresults. Sentiment was not helped by vague talk that the company would\\nannounce a rights issue and maybe a deal to buy a stake in Wellcome - not an\\nidea new to the market. Level headed traders disbelieved this theory, and\\npointed to Wellcome's relatively steady performance yesterday in quiet\\ntrading. ICI, 18 off at one stage, ended 13 down on balance at 1070p.\\nWellcome eased 3 to 527p.\\nLegal & General retreated 13 to 438p on 1.7m, upset by downgradings from a\\nnumber of broking firms. London and Manchester was slightly easier at 337p\\nafter new business figures described as disappointing by one trader.\\nA number of downgrades kept the composite insurances under persistent\\npressure. Analysts are now expecting all the big five composites to show\\nlosses for the current year.\\nGeneral Accident and Guardian Royal are expected to record losses of around\\nPounds 100m, Royals some Pounds 90m, Sun Alliance Pounds 70m to Pounds 80m\\nand Commercial Union around Pounds 30m. The biggest turnover, 3.5m, was in\\nGuardian Royal, 4 off at 204p, while Royals dipped 7 to 449p, General\\nAccident 5 to 532p and Sun Alliance 3 to 363p.\\nSome keen two-way interest was shown in Amstrad, which settled unchanged on\\nthe day at 76p, having eased earlier in the session. The early uncertainty\\ncame as Kleinwort Benson downgraded its profits estimates for the group. For\\nthis year Kleinwort has cut its forecast from Pounds 44m to Pounds 36m and\\nfor next year it has moved from Pounds 60m to Pounds 55m.\\nMs Judy Stewart at Kleinwort said the lower forecast followed on from a\\nnumber of bearish signs in the computer industry.\\nIt was also pointed out that Amstrad had been selling significant amounts of\\nstock in Micron, the computer chip manufacturer, where some 3.5m shares were\\nacquired in October 1988. Amstrad said it had sold 2.2m of these shares.\\nJames Capel, Amstrad's broker, is believed to have downgraded the stock.\\nWardle Storeys began to reap the rewards of a series of presentations hosted\\nby Smith New Court to Scottish investment institutions. Smith believes there\\nis a more realistic air about the company these days and, in spite of the\\ndownturn, a more robust feel about the potential. The shares bounced 11 to\\n309p.\\nNegative comment on the refinancing exercise caused investors to have second\\nthoughts about Cannon Street Investments and the shares consequently gave\\nback part of Tuesday's sharp rise to close 12 down at 112p.\\nMorgan Crucible regained some of the ground lost since last week's rights\\nissue announcement, ending 8 better at 241p.\\nFears that Vickers may tell today's annual meeting of falling sales for\\nRolls-Royce cars and warn about profits from the luxury car division put the\\nshares down 6 more to 211p.\\nAerospace Engineering moved ahead 5 to 54p after favourable comment.\\nIbex Holdings, the recruitment consultancy and employment agency, plunged 7\\nto 11p on news that a bid may be made at a level 'materially lower' than the\\ncurrent market price.\\nMotor distributor Jessups dropped 9 to 46p after revealing losses and a\\ndividend cut at the half-way stage.\\nInvestors continued to favour Betterware Consumer Products and, in thin\\ntrading, the price advanced 15 further to the highest level this year of\\n227p. The annual results are expected in June.\\nThe recent rise in oil shares, stimulated by higher crude prices and the\\nstrength of the dollar, was reversed yesterday. The appearance of a number\\nof big institutional sellers accompanied a decline in oil prices and a hefty\\nprofits downgrade in BP by Strauss Turnbull, one of the market's big bears\\nof the oil sector.\\nMr John Toalster, oil sector guru at Strauss, cut his current year net\\nincome forecast for BP from Pounds 960m to Pounds 700m and said the group\\nmay well struggle to achieve this figure.\\nHe estimated that BP's first-quarter income, due to be announced on May 9,\\nwould show a loss of Pounds 125m. Mr Toalster said BP would be hard pressed\\nto pay a forecast increase of 4.8 per cent in its final dividend this year.\\nSome big selling, much of it by Strauss clients, left BP 4 1/2 off at 349\\n1/2 p on turnover of 7.6m shares. Shell, where turnover was a more sedate\\n4.1m, settled 3 easier at 521p.\\nIn a quiet property sector, Brixton Estates climbed 13 to 174p after\\npublishing results at the top end of analysts' expectations. Full year\\nprofits were more than 15 per cent better at Pounds 23.6m and traders were\\nimpressed by the published net asset value and the dividend increase.\\nTraders said a cross of 450,000 Percy Bilton shares took place at 404p. It\\nleft the stock 14 down at 394p.\\nThe current series of presentations by Rank Organisation to brokers\\ngenerated yet another change of forecast.

The Pounds 8.41m loss on the sale appeared as an extraordinary\\nitem.\\nInterest on ongoing activities also rose to Pounds 3.13m (Pounds 246,000),\\nlargely because of the increased carrying cost of completed development\\nproperties.\\nDebt fell to Pounds 31m (Pounds 48m) and gearing fell slightly from 114 to\\n98 per cent, excluding Pounds 17m of guaranteed debt relating to associated\\ncompany investments.\\nSir Lewis Robertson, chairman, said the result was 'not unsatisfactory',\\ngiven the tough market conditions. The decline had resulted from the\\nproperty and housebuilding activities but sales and profits in the\\nconstruction-related operations had improved. The group had opened offices\\nin the Midlands and south of England and was well positioned to take\\nadvantage of a turnround in the economy.\\nCurrently Lilley has a land bank sufficient for four years.

Calls for Germany to cut interest rates are, from our point of\\nview, difficult to understand. Other countries, for instance in the European\\nMonetary System, are making use of the relative weakness of the D-Mark to\\ncut their own interest rates without our having to do so.'\\nMr Pohl, a pivotal figure in negotiations on European monetary integration,\\nwelcomed Tuesday's proposal from Luxembourg to set up a European central\\nbank during the transition to monetary union, but to delay its creation\\nuntil 1996.\\n'This suggestion goes in the right direction, but we will have to study it\\ncarefully before coming to a final judgment.'\\nAdding an important refinement to the Bundesbank's thinking on a European\\ncentral bank, he said: 'It is important that a decision on setting up a\\nEuropean central bank is not taken until it is clear which countries are\\nwilling to transfer their monetary policy powers to this institution.'\\nOnce this had become clear, Mr Pohl said, 'a European central bank could be\\nset up two years before it would actually become fully operational, to allow\\nthe necessary time for preparation'.\\nCommenting on the interest rate controversy, where Mr Nicholas Brady, the US\\ntreasury secretary, has urged Germany to ease policies in recent informal\\nmeetings, Mr Pohl declared: 'German monetary policy has to remain tight'.\\nThe issue is expected to surface during the G7 meeting of finance ministers\\nand central bankers from the US, UK, France, Italy, Canada, Japan and\\nGermany.\\nThe US calls have been part of Washington's effort to damp the risk of\\nworldwide recession. However, Mr Pohl pointed out that parts of the west\\nGerman economy were experiencing overheating. Recalling west Germany's\\nstrong growth of 4.5 per cent last year and still-low inflation of 2.5 per\\ncent, he said: 'The position of the German economy as seen abroad has been\\nmade worse than we deserve. East Germany is an enormous problem, but the\\nsituation in west Germany is basically very satisfactory'.\\nEasing monetary reins could prove counter-productive as it might weaken\\nconfidence in the D-Mark, he said. 'If we followed an easier policy, and\\nthis had an effect on the D-Mark, the result would be that German interest\\nrates would not be lower, but higher.'\\nMr Pohl, who in unguarded comments last month called the aftermath of German\\nmonetary union a 'disaster', said: 'The situation in east Germany was\\nportrayed by the government (in Bonn) rather too favourably last year. Now\\ncomes the moment of truth.'\\nHe suggested the Bonn government, through tax increases announced two months\\nago, had reacted to the challenges somewhat late. 'Now, the best time to ask\\npeople to make sacrifices is past. In calling for a greater national effort\\nthe politicians could have been a bit more Churchillian.'\\n'Public sector transfers to east Germany this year will come to around\\nDM140bn (Pounds 48.2bn). Two-thirds of the gross national product in the\\neast effectively comes from the west. A lot of the transfers are financing\\nconsumption - unemployment benefits, pensions etc - but there is an\\nincreasing amount of investment too.'\\nOver the timing of eventual recovery east of the Elbe he said: 'There is not\\nmuch sense in trying to predict an end to the period of slump - it will\\ncertainly last some time. But in east Germany they are now drawing the right\\nconsequences from the fact that 80 per cent of the economy there is\\nuncompetitive. This means of course that a large number of lay-offs are\\ninevitable.'\\nINTERVENTION BY CENTRAL BANKS FAILS TO HELP D-MARK\\nIntervention by European central banks failed to reduce the value of the\\ndollar and support a sagging D-Mark, writes Peter Marsh. Eleven banks, led\\nby the German Bundesbank, sold dollars for the second day in an effort to\\nlift the D-Mark, which has been hit in recent weeks by worries about the\\nGerman economy. However, the effort was hampered by the lack of any sign\\nthat the US Federal Reserve was joining the operation. The Fed is thought to\\nbe disinclined to support the campaign, on the grounds that a strong dollar\\nmay make it easier to cut US interest rates. In London, the dollar gained\\nmore than 1 pfennig at DM1.7535 and its strength depressed sterling, which\\nclosed at Dollars 1.6945, down by just under 1 cent. Against the D-Mark,\\nsterling lost 1 pfennig to DM2.9725. Later in New York, the D-Mark regained\\nsome lost ground against the dollar to close at DM1.7465.

Not so today. When the gentlemen from\\nFord, Vauxhall, Peugeot Talbot and Rover paid a visit yesterday to the\\nchancellor of the Exchequer, they were clearly anxious not to be seen as one\\nmore lobby group bent on presenting a shopping list. So much so that it is\\ntempting to wonder whether they may not have undersold their case.\\nOstensibly, the visit was made to establish whether there had been an\\nadverse shift in policy towards the motor industry, following a Budget which\\nlaunched a vigorous assault on company car benefits, raised the rate of VAT\\nand increased fuel tax. Such modest ambition, if that is what it was, looks\\nentirely realistic. Not only have successive Conservative chancellors\\nreduced the emphasis upon manufacturing; they have also taken a relaxed view\\nof balance of payments deficits which are heavily influenced by motor\\nindustry performance and, with obvious exceptions, adopted a robust stance\\nto-wards special interest groups.\\nLamont hostile\\nEven so, the thrust of the industry's approach hardly looks well directed.\\nMr Lamont has already shown himself instinctively hostile to trade\\nassociations that fail to present a strong economic case. And it is hard to\\nargue with those of his Budget measures that most rankle with the motor\\nindustry, notably the introduction of national insurance contributions for\\nemployers on company cars, together with scale charge increases. For\\ntravelling salesmen, the company car is a genuine business necessity. For\\nmost company executives it is simply a perk and an economically inefficient\\nperk at that, in that it distorts and diminishes choice. Companies buy more\\nexpensive cars for their employees than those employees would choose to buy\\nfrom taxed income. The type of the car may also be dictated by status in the\\nfirm rather than personal preference.\\nOne of the more welcome features of the Thatcher years has been the\\nreduction in the top marginal rates of income tax that made reliefs for\\nfringe benefits so attractive in the first place. The system has\\nprogressively moved from one in which people were rewarded with allowances\\nand reliefs for belonging to particular groups - pensioners, farmers,\\nparents or senior managers with cars - to one where the rewards are\\nincreasingly granted for the expenditure of productive effort. The real\\nquestion is whether the assault on company cars should be extended to other\\nperks.\\nPowerful case\\nSo much the better, then, that Mr Lamont told the motor industry leaders\\nthat he would consider doing precisely that. He also indicated that he would\\nlook at the question in the context of the overall tax burden, which makes\\nequally good sense. And it is here that the motor industry, with support\\nfrom the Commons trade and industry committee, has a powerful case to make.\\nThe 10 per cent special car tax, which is charged on the wholesale price of\\na car, is unquestionably discriminatory. There is no reason why cars should\\nbe penalised relative to washing machines other than that the exchequer wins\\nlarge revenues.\\nNor does the tax make wider economic or environmental sense. By choosing to\\nincrease the initial cost rather than impose the burden on fuel consumption\\nthe government simply reinforces the pressure for congestion: once the\\npurchaser has bought the car at the inflated price, the marginal cost of\\nroad use is insignificant. Shifting the burden on to fuel consumption would\\nhave the additional advantage of encouraging the public to trade up from\\nolder, fuel-inefficient cars to modern vehicles with better environmental\\ncredentials. Ideally such a change should be accompanied by an assault on\\nindustry-restrictive practices that result in retail buyers in Britain\\npaying up to 30 per cent more than many continental Europeans for their\\ncars. The opportunity may come when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission\\nreports on the issues later this year.\"},\n",

But the bold strategy outlined last week has\\nput congressional Democrats on the defensive and delighted some\\neducationalists. Mr Albert Shanker, of the American Federation of Teachers\\n(and no particular friend of the White House), was not happy with every\\nsmall detail. But he graciously described the package as a 'major turning\\npoint in the history of American education'. No previous US president, he\\nsaid, had taken such a detailed interest in the future of school education.\\nMr Lamar Alexander, Mr Bush's eloquent education secretary, can claim most\\nof the credit. Unlike many cabinet appointees, Mr Alexander knows his\\nsubject: as governor of Tennessee in the 1980s, he was one of the first\\nstate leaders to recognise the importance of school reform.\\nThe America 2000 programme bears a striking - if unacknowledged -\\nresemblance to the UK educational reforms of the last Thatcher government.\\nThe Thatcher strategy had three main elements: a new national curriculum;\\nmeasures to promote competition and parental choice; and business-funded\\nschools to 'break the mould' of bureaucratic local authority schools.\\nEach element is precisely mirrored in the White House plan. The main\\ndifference is that Mr Bush lacks a British prime minister's powers. The US\\nconstitution grants state and local governments primary responsibility for\\neducation. Federal educational spending accounts for only about 6 per cent\\nof the total school budget. With few direct powers and little financial\\nleverage, Mr Bush must rely heavily on his powers of persuasion.\\nThe parallel to the UK's national curriculum is a set of new 'world\\nstandards' to be developed in each of five core subjects: English, maths,\\nscience, history and geography. Mr David Kearns, the deputy education\\nsecretary and former president of Xerox, argues that US businesses began to\\nmake progress in the 1980s only when they started comparing themselves with\\n'the best in the world'. US schools are now being set the same challenge.\\nTo measure performance in the core subjects, Mr Bush is planning the first\\nnational examination system in US history, to be known as American\\nAchievement Tests. These will be taken at the ages of about 10, 14 and 18.\\nNational tests could make a substantial difference: for the first time it\\nwill be possible to compare performance not only between school districts\\nbut between states. In future, Mississippi parents will be aware if their\\nchildren's results are lower than those of students in New York or\\nCalifornia or - in theory - Tokyo.\\nCritics argue that national tests will kill educational diversity and\\ninhibit teachers. They say US children are already burdened with too many\\ntests. Mr Alexander's response is convincing: the new exams will replace,\\nrather than add to, existing tests. They are intended to be of a higher\\nquality than the multiple-choice quizzes on which most American children are\\nreared: students will be expected to write essays and solve complex\\nmathematical problems as is commonplace in Europe and Japan. 'Teaching to\\nthe test' may, therefore, promote better teaching. Finally, students in\\ndifferent states may not need to take the same exams: different tests\\ncalibrated to the same educational standards (rather like different A-level\\nexam boards in England) may be used.\\nFor constitutional reasons, the national tests will be voluntary. But\\ncolleges and employers will be encouraged to use them for selection\\npurposes. Presidential citations will be awarded to students who do\\nexceptionally well.\\nThe second main plank in Mr Bush's strategy mirrors UK efforts to promote\\ncompetition between schools. The Thatcher government passed legislation in\\n1988 giving parents a wider choice of schools within local authorities.\\nSchools were also given the right to 'opt out' of local authority control\\nand be funded directly by Whitehall.\\nMr Alexander would love to possess such powers. 'I don't know how we ever\\ngot into this situation in America of denying a broad choice of schools to\\nparents,' he says. 'Everything else in America we choose: our cars, our\\ncities, our jobs, where we live.' Eight states have already passed 'school\\nchoice' reforms. But the administration intends to inject momentum into the\\nchoice movement by offering about Dollars 200m in incentives to states and\\nlocal governments that pass legislation promoting competition. Mr Alexander\\nalso wants to revise the federal government's Dollars 6bn programme for\\ndisadvantaged and under-achieving pupils (known as Chapter 1) so that\\n'federal dollars follow the child to whatever extent state and local\\npolicies permit'.\\nMeasures to permit greater choice among public schools are likely to be\\ngrudgingly accepted, although there is little evidence that they raise\\neducational standards. Critics rightly worry that schools may end up\\nselecting pupils rather than parents selecting schools. If that happens, the\\nalready troubling segregation by race and class caused by distinct black and\\nwhite residential districts could be exacerbated.\\nWhat most alarms critics, however, is the suggestion that, as a result of\\nchoice policies, public money might flow to private and Catholic schools. Mr\\nAlexander points out that the GI bill subsidising the college education of\\nex-servicemen after the Second World War did not stipulate that the money\\nmust be spent in the public sector. By analogy he would like disadvantaged\\nchildren to be able to spend Chapter 1 dollars in private schools. Opponents\\nsay this would wreck the finances of already underfunded inner-city public\\nschools.\\nThe third main element in the Bush strategy closely parallels the British\\ncity technology colleges initiative. The Thatcher government sought business\\nbacking for the creation of new schools that would act as 'beacons of\\nexcellence' for the public sector.\\nMr Bush is doing the same - only on a grander scale. Under the plan, the\\nbusiness community will raise Dollars 150-Dollars 200m to fund the New\\nAmerican Schools Development Corporation, a new non-profit organisation.\\nThis will award contracts next year to between three and seven research and\\ndevelopment (R&D) teams drawn from companies, universities, think tanks and\\nothers. The R&D teams' task will be to 're-invent the public school'. The\\ngoal is to have at least 535 new-style schools - at least one for each\\ncongressional district - in operation by 1996.\\nIt is easy to mock the notion of 'reinventing' public schools. But the plan\\nhas real potential: schools are arguably one of the few institutions that\\nhave failed to adapt to great social and economic changes in the 20th\\ncentury. Mr Alexander expects the R&D teams to begin by 'erasing all\\nconventional assumptions and constraints' about schooling, such as the\\ncalendar and schedule, the curriculum, the class size, and the nature of\\nlearning materials. The only constraint is that the new schools should\\nachieve the standards set in the new national exams at a cost no greater\\nthan that of conventional schools. US ingenuity just might produce an\\neducational innovation the rest of the world will want to copy.\\nMr Alexander carefully describes the reform package as a 'national strategy'\\nrather than a federal policy. At a cost of only Dollars 690m, the programme\\ncan hardly be said to be usurping the educational role of the states. There\\nare certainly big omissions: the White House is offering neither new money\\nnor new ideas in the vital area of pre-school education. It is doing nothing\\nto reduce vast disparities in educational spending in rich and poor\\ndistricts (it is not even trying to shame states into making equal\\neducational opportunity a reality). But some of the proposals - particularly\\nnational exams and research into new schools - deserve congressional and\\nstate support.\\nThe strategy cannot hope to raise educational standards quickly: no policy\\nframed in Washington could do that. But there are enough ideas to take the\\nbite out of criticism that Mr Bush lacks a domestic agenda. To the\\nconsternation of Democrats, the 'education president' is in danger of living\\nup to his name.\"},\n",
       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-3231, TEXT: ON WEDNESDAY night last week, Daniel paid a visit to the lions' den. Daniel\\nwas Mr James Leek, chief executive of the Caparo Group. The den was\\nChartered Accountants' Hall, packed full for the inaugural meeting of the\\nLondon Practitioner Board of the London Society of Chartered Accountants.\\nThe Caparo Group, a quoted industrial holdings company, is less well known\\nfor its products than for the legal decision that bears its name. Indeed,\\nthe Caparo decision which was taken in the House of Lords in January last\\nyear has become a landmark case for the profession.\\nThe essence of last year's decision was that a company's auditors do not owe\\na duty of care to potential investors in the company or to the company's\\nindividual shareholders.\\nThat decision sharply circumscribed the responsibilities of the auditing\\nprofession to third-party users of accounts. As a Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte\\nbooklet puts it: 'An investor or shareholder who relies on the company's\\nstatutory accounts when deciding to purchase shares in the company has no\\nclaim against the auditors if the accounts are negligently prepared.'\\nThe decision followed a long battle with Touche Ross over the latter's audit\\nof Fidelity, an electronics company bought by Caparo in November 1985 in a\\nPounds 13.5m hostile takeover bid. Soon afterwards it became clear that all\\nwas not well with the stock or the level of reported profits, and the\\nbusiness was shut down and the Fidelity brand name sold.\\nCaparo then took legal action against Touche and against Messrs Stephen and\\nRobert Dickman, directors of the company. The Dickman brothers were found\\nguilty of fraud in February this year.\\nThe original battle with Touche was fought over the technical legal point of\\nwhether that firm could owe a duty of care to Caparo. Caparo has recently\\nlaunched a new legal action against Touche alleging negligence.\\nAccountants were quick to welcome last year's decision, which in reducing\\ntheir responsibilities also reduced their exposure to potential liabilities.\\nAfter years of mounting litigation against the profession, that initial\\nreaction was understandable; but more recently euphoria has given way to\\nconcern. Industry has always resented paying for the audit, which is, after\\nall, a statutory obligation rather than a business necessity.\\nThe Caparo decision has exacerbated widespread disillusion about the purpose\\nof an audit. Why have one at all if the auditors cannot be sued by third\\nparties even if their work is negligent?\\nMr Leek, a chartered accountant himself, observed that the profession did\\nnot know how to react to the decision. Many accountants recognised that\\npublic confidence in the profession was at stake, he said, but others were\\ncontent to hide behind the letter of the newly defined law.\\nHe complained that there had been no public statement of any significance on\\nCaparo from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.\\n'They have set up an auditing committee to examine the issues of the\\nso-called expectation gap (between what the public thinks auditors are doing\\nand what they themselves believe to be their duties), but the committee's\\nterms of reference read rather like a PR protection exercise for our own\\nprofession, and in particular there is no mention of the Caparo case\\nitself.'\\nHe accused the profession of sheltering behind two fine legal distinctions,\\nsaying either 'a shareholder who loses money as a result of my negligent\\nauditing cannot sue me, but the client company can', or 'you can sue me on a\\nprospectus (in which auditors explicitly accept liability for their audit\\nreports) but not on a set of audited accounts'.\\nMr Leek had his own suggestions for the reform of the audit law. Here are\\nthe 'Caparo Five'.\\nAuditors should be made liable for their negligence to those users of\\naccounts who suffer loss after taking decisions based on those accounts.\\nThat would require a legislative change.\\nAuditors should have a better defence against the increased liability which\\nthe first reform would bring about. 'That defence is the abolition of the\\npresent three-line 'true and fair' audit report,' Mr Leek argued. 'It has\\nbecome meaningless and leaves so much unsaid.' Auditors should be encouraged\\nto use qualified audit reports more frequently, where there is reasonable\\nground for discomfort on either the accuracy or presentation of the figures.\\nAuditors should be encouraged to make available to shareholders a summary of\\ntheir report to management - a report comprising an auditor's statement of\\naccounting and control deficiencies and the client's response to them. 'This\\nwould enable shareholders to judge the quality and standard of accounting\\nand control in their company.'\\nMr Leek argued: 'The relationship between auditors and their clients should\\nbe made less cosy. To reinforce the auditor's independence there should, for\\npublicly quoted companies, be a limit to the number of years for which an\\nauditor may be reappointed, and the amount of fee income from services other\\nthan audit and taxation. It would also be helpful to find a better mechanism\\nfor shareholders' involvement in the actual appointment and selection of\\nauditors. At present they are merely a rubber stamp for the directors'\\nrecommendation.' There should be an independent review body to hear cases of\\nauditors' negligence. The new Auditing Practices Board, successor to the\\nAuditing Practices Committee, will not fulfil this role, although a greater\\nnumber of non-accountants will be involved in setting auditing standards.\\nMr Leek made clear that the process of reform could not, indeed should not,\\nbe left to the accountancy profession alone. He said it could only arrive as\\na result of consensus between institutions, private shareholders, the\\ngovernment, companies - and the profession itself. Given the difficulties\\nthat the various branches of the accountancy profession have in agreeing\\nwith themselves on anything, such a consensus is unlikely.\\nNevertheless, Mr Leek's speech was a rare, constructive contribution to the\\nexpectation gap debate. Coming from the company whose actions prompted the\\ndebate in the first place, his suggestions are all the more welcome.\\nAn eerie calm had descended on Chartered Accountants' Hall by the time Mr\\nLeek sat down. Only one person dared challenge him. The others appeared\\nstruck dumb by the wisdom of what the Caparo chief executive had had to say\\n -Daniel had silenced the lions.\"},\n",

       " {\"DOCNO: FT911-3236, TEXT: THIS year the government's side in pay talks with the two largest groups of\\ncivil servants was led by two people new to salary negotiations. If the\\nunions hoped for an easy time through their opponents' inexperience,\\nhowever, they have been disappointed.\\nMs Gillian Shephard, minister of state at the Treasury, and Ms Anthea Case,\\nsenior civil servant, pitched an offer low enough to provoke the first\\nsignificant challenge to long-term pay agreements since they were introduced\\ninto the Civil Service four years ago.\\nThe challenge arose from union perceptions that the 8 per cent pay offer\\nbreaks the spirit of the long-term agreements. It was probably not unwelcome\\nto a government keen to show the private sector how to conclude low pay\\ndeals but severely constrained in its ability to do so this year because of\\nclauses in the deals.\\nThe problem for the leaderships of the CPSA and NUCPS unions is that the\\noffer does not break the letter of the long-term agreements. They were\\ntherefore faced with recommending acceptance of the 8 per cent offer, or\\nmoving towards industrial action which they knew their members were\\nreluctant to take. The CPSA executive this week decided on acceptance; the\\nNUCPS recommended rejection, with the possibility of a ballot on industrial\\naction.\\nWhatever the result of that ballot, the unions' hostile response has\\ndeflected attention from the potentially embarrassing fact that the 8 per\\ncent offer could be interpreted as inflationary. The retail prices index is\\nexpected to fall to below 7 per cent this month; the offer is due for\\nimplementation from April 1.\\nAn inflation-plus deal does not look good for a government that is\\nconstantly preaching that employers should make 'affordable' pay rises,\\ninterpreted by most as meaning below inflation.\\nThe government has not escaped without criticism. Shortly after the offer\\nwas announced, Mr John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of\\nBritish Industry, observed that public pay was rising too fast, threatening\\n'further essential cuts in interest rates'. But the criticisms would have\\nbeen worse without the public controversy over the offers.\\nIn the Civil Service negotiations, the government's hand was forced by the\\nlong-term pay agreements through which rises are linked to increases in the\\nprivate sector. The Civil Service rises must fall in the middle 50 per cent\\nof the private sector increases during the previous year.\\nRising inflation works to the government's benefit because private sector\\nearnings tend to track the retail prices index. As inflation falls, as now,\\nthe opposite occurs and the Treasury's comparability concessions cause\\ndifficulties.\\nThe advantage for the government of the long-term deal is that the unions\\nhave allowed the Treasury more flexibility in where to target money. In the\\nfirst years of the deals, high performing civil servants in London - where\\nrecruitment and retention were most difficult - were awarded higher rises\\nthan others.\\nThis year the high rises have been targeted at the low-paid who have won up\\nto 11 per cent. Most of the more than 300,000 civil servants covered by the\\noffers will receive between 7.6 per cent and 7.8 per cent.\\nThat is what has angered the unions who say the long-term agreements would\\nonly be honoured in spirit if all members were offered at least 8 per cent,\\nthe lowest point of the middle 50 per cent in the private sector.\\nIn spite of their annoyance, there is little support among the two unions'\\nleaderships for pulling out of the agreements.\\nMr John Ellis, CPSA general secretary, said yesterday that the agreements\\nhave stabilised industrial relations in the Civil Service, making strikes\\nsuch as those staged in 1981 and 1987 less likely. Until this year they have\\nalso provided fair increases, he says.\\nHe estimates that without the long-term agreements, this year's offer would\\nonly have been about 6 per cent. His union will push for changes to the\\nagreements, for example to make more use of arbitration.\\nThe NUCPS, the most reluctant of the Civil Service unions to join the\\nlong-term agreements, is less positive about them. It is not hostile,\\nhowever, and its leadership will argue against withdrawal at this year's\\nannual conference.\\nSignificantly, the union's executive did not this week order an immediate\\nballot on industrial action. That would only come if members supported the\\nrejection recommendation and the government continued to reject arbitration.\\nThat means industrial action can be virtually ruled out. A ballot may\\neventually be held on industrial action, but it will come at a time when the\\ninflation rate is considerably less than the value of the offer. In a\\nrecession, when hundreds of thousands of workers are being made redundant,\\nfew workers would strike for an improvement to an inflation-plus offer.\"},\n",

There is also a wealth of additional information from\\nlocal property sales.\\n'The basic prescription of 22m homes allocated to seven bands is sensible\\nand, for 90 per cent of properties, readily achievable,' said Mr Michael\\nPattison, secretary general of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.\\nMr Charles Partridge of Herring Son & Daw, the chartered surveyors, said:\\n'It is the ideal approach because everyone understands capital values, and\\nputting each property into a broad band is not a difficult job.'\\nThe Inland Revenue's valuation office will be responsible for allocating\\neach property to one of the seven bands, which in England will range from up\\nto Pounds 40,000 to over Pounds 160,000, with lower levels operating in\\nScotland and Wales.\\nBut because its resources are already fully stretched by appeals against\\nuniform business rate demands, much of the work is certain to be contracted\\nout to private sector professionals.\\nAccording to the RICS, the government could adopt a 'beacon' system of\\nvaluation under which a typical property would be chosen as the basis of\\nvaluation for similar properties in the same area.\\nA terrace house, for example, could be used to provide a representative\\nvalue for all properties in the same terrace, and in some cases whole areas\\ncould be valued in this way.\\nThe assumption is that most householders would be likely to accept the\\nbanding decisions, which because of the amount of information available,\\nshould be consistent with their own views on the market value of their\\nhomes.\\nThis method of valuation would be a rough and ready means of valuation and\\nso a right of appeal will be vital.\\nProblems arise at the margin of each band and at the precise point in a\\nstreet or estate where the properties have been allocated to the next band.\\nMr Pattison forecast that in some cases there could be agitation to get a\\nproperty or housing estate into a higher band, despite the cost, because of\\nthe extra social cachet this could provide.\\nUnlike the rating system, home improvements will not automatically mean a\\nchange of band, and any alterations might only be taken into account when a\\nproperty changes hands.\\nAmong questions still to be answered are whether leasehold properties will\\nbe valued at their freehold value; how will 'unorthodox' types of property\\nsuch as caravans and houseboats be treated; and will banding be subject to\\nsome form of indexation.\"},\n",

Both take as their basis the\\ninclusion of the community charge reduction scheme with the revenue support\\ngrant (although Labour counts it as about Pounds 1bn while the Tories count\\nit as Pounds 1.25bn); both assume that collection will be much better than\\nfor the poll tax (the Tories calculating on 100 per cent collection and\\nLabour on 98 per cent - as it was under the rates); and both assume\\nsignificant savings on collection costs (Labour of Pounds 400,000 and the\\nTories of Pounds 320,000).\\nBoth parties also compare the new system with headline poll tax figures this\\nyear given actual council spending, and no increase in the total from the\\nbusiness rate.\\nLabour's attack on the figures will include sustained questioning of the\\nvaluation which formed the basis of the property profile given for each\\narea.\\nParty officials doubt that sampling will have been extensive and describe\\nthe exercise as 'pretty spurious'.\\nMr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, ascribed the difference\\nin average household figures to the fact that Labour was aiming to raise\\nonly Pounds 6.3bn from local taxes instead of the Pounds 6.8bn government\\nfigures represented.\\nTory officials also say the Pounds 400 average household figure is based on\\nthe median house price, reflecting the range of council tax bills to be\\npaid. Labour's refusal to give details of distribution of bills under its\\nproposals means that there is no directly comparable figure for the\\nopposition's system.\\nLabour offers a different explanation. It says the limit on top band\\ncontributions in the council tax and the 25 per cent discount for\\nsingle-person households means that to compensate, the average household\\npays more than if the tax were fully progressive.\\nIt agrees, however, that it assumes greater savings from the higher\\ncollection rate than the government is doing - a point where independent\\nexperts thought they had overestimated by Pounds 600,000 - but adds that the\\nsame experts agreed with their conclusions of a Pounds 140 savings for an\\naverage household.\\nMr David Blunkett, the opposition local-government spokesman, said: 'Our\\nfigures are robust, real and verified by independent analysts. Their figures\\nare a fairy tale without a happy ending.'\\nThe ending to both stories looks likely to come only after the general\\nelection.\"},\n",

The only circumstance in\\nwhich rates could be cut would be if US economic developments turned out to\\nbe weaker than projected.

The\\nmoves could signal a new willingness by Japan to contribute to world affairs\\nfollowing international criticism of its passiveness during the Gulf war.\\nThe despatch of six ships is the first time since 1945 that Japanese troops\\nhave been sent on active service overseas. But Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the\\nJapanese prime minister, said in a rare televised press conference last\\nnight that the move would not set a precedent for sending other Japanese\\nmilitary forces abroad in future. He insisted Japan remained wedded to its\\npeace constitution.\\nHe urged the government\\'s critics at home and overseas to show their support\\n -an appeal aimed particularly at China, which has expressed concern that\\nthe minesweeping mission might set a dangerous precedent. Mr Kaifu will have\\nfurther opportunities to reassure Japan\\'s Asian neighbours during a tour of\\nsouth-east Asia next week.\\nMr Kaifu spelt out reasons why Japan felt it was now right to send\\nminesweepers after the government had rejected the idea in 1987 and again\\nlast year. First, since the Gulf war was finished, there was little risk of\\nJapanese servicemen being drawn into combat,a development which could\\ninfringe the peace constitution.\\nNext, minesweeping was different from other kinds of military duty so no\\ndangerous precedents would be set; then, the safety of ships, including oil\\ntankers bound for Japan, had to be secured; also, the Gulf states needed the\\nmines cleared before they could rebuild their economies; finally, Japan had\\nto make a bigger contribution to the world.\\nMr Kaifu said: \\'It is not right for Japan to stay aloof from the rest of the\\nworld.\"\\nGermany\\'s decision to send troops to Iran, following talks with the Iranian\\ngovernment, comes soon after its own decision to send minesweepers to the\\nGulf.

The IGCs were studiously ignoring the\\nimplications of the Community growing to 24 members, the Commissioner\\ncomplained.\\nMr Andriessen's idea that countries could select certain EC activities in\\nwhich to participate as full members may speed membership bids from European\\nFree Trade Association (Efta) countries. Just when Efta's frustration is\\nreaching breaking point at being offered only a voice on the key EC\\nlegislation - that would form the core of the planned European Economic Area\\n(EEA) - up pops someone in Brussels with a scheme to give them a vote.\\nTalks are being held today between senior officials and next month between\\nministers to save the EEA negotiations; but if they fail, Sweden may not be\\nthe only Efta country this summer to follow Austria in applying to join the\\nEC club.\\nIn fact, the IGC on political union has now agreed on a kind of variable\\ners. This divides Community activities into three:\\nStandard policies (still largely economic) set by the standard machinery of\\nthe Council/Parliament legislating on Commission proposals.\\nCommon foreign and security policy with a relatively small role for the\\nCommission and almost none for the Parliament.\\nA purely inter-governmental area of co-operation on police and judicial\\nissues such as drugs, crime and immigration.\\nFor all, actual and potential members alike, the most sensitive aspect is\\ndefence, on which there are now three competing drafts. The Luxembourg\\npresidency proposes that defence matters 'can' be wholly or partly dealt\\nwith by the Western European Union (WEU) with a review in 1996; the\\nNetherlands, backed by the UK, proposes that all defence matters 'will' be\\ntreated by WEU; and France wants some EC involvement, at summit level, in\\ndefence from the outset and the 1996 review to create a common EC defence\\npolicy.\\nThis internal debate will divide outsiders. East Europeans, frustrated by\\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's refusal to offer them any formal\\nassociation, may want to see a common EC defence policy that one day might\\ncover them, while neutral Efta countries hope no such policy will emerge.\\nAnother indicator of how supranational the Community may become is the\\ndegree to which the European Parliament is given a say in EC law-making\\nequal to that enjoyed by the Council of Ministers. Luxembourg proposes\\ngiving MEPs, whose present amending powers depend crucially on Commission\\nsupport, a right of 'co-decision' on a new category of framework laws.\\nThis goes too far for countries such as Britain and Denmark, but has been\\nstrongly attacked by the Parliament which (along with Germany) wants\\nco-decision across the board and by the Commission which sees its brokering\\nrole in legislation disappearing. The Luxembourg plan calls for a\\n'conciliation committee' between the Parliament and Council - akin to the\\nCapitol Hill 'conferences' that resolve deadlocks between the two houses of\\nthe US Congress - with the Commission shut out.\\nIn comparison to the feverish discussions on political union, the IGC on\\neconomic and monetary union (Emu) has been more akin to a leisurely academic\\nseminar. Perhaps because of this, the heat has been taken out of the crucial\\ntransition question for the UK government: how to sign an Emu treaty without\\ncommitting itself to a timetable to join in a single currency?\\nThere now seems to be near-consensus on two negative principles, according\\nto one IGC negotiator, in which no country could be compelled by the others\\ninto Emu, and no country could defy others in insisting on joining Emu. Were\\nit not, therefore, for approaching UK election fever, Prime Minister John\\nMajor's government could feel comfortable.\\nThis is, however, a side-show for the other 11 countries which are still\\narguing about what economic discipline is needed to bolster a monetary\\nunion, and what powers the planned European central bank should have before\\nit starts running a single currency.\\nGermany has so far played it tough.

It is a much more precise description than talking about the\\nestablishment of a political union in Europe.\\nWe should not underestimate the magnitude of our job. And for one simple\\nreason: the political and economic landscape in Europe has undergone\\nsignificant changes.\\nAfter the Gulf war it has become clear that the threats to our societies\\nhave diversified. We should no longer pay attention to the developments in\\nthe Soviet Union only. Crises in the Near and Middle East, mass-migration,\\nworld poverty and threats against the environment should be added to the\\nlist.\\nDenmark considers the European Community to be the most important block on\\nwhich to build our New Europe. It has a true magnetic pull. It is based on\\nlaw. It is based on sound principles: basically shifting coalitions between\\nmember states - which make the national interests converge. Not a small\\nachievement, considering Europe's past.\\nAt the inter-governmental conferences (IGC) we now have to sketch out a way\\ntowards an economic and monetary union (Emu) and towards a political union.\\nDenmark has tabled proposals which show a way forward. Our goal is to widen\\nand deepen the Community. We want to enlarge it with new member states: the\\nEfta (European Free Trade Association) countries and countries in central\\nand eastern Europe. We also want to strike a balance between growing\\ninternationalisation and regionalism. We want to shape a new relationship\\nbetween the over-regulated society and market forces.\\nOriginally, the European Community was set up in order to promote and\\nenhance French/German reconciliation. The goals were political, the means\\neconomic. History forces us to redress the former equation. We have to\\ndiscuss how to handle the questions of a common foreign and security policy,\\nof the European pillar in the defence of Europe.\\nIn essence, it is necessary to strike a proper balance between the European\\nCommunity, WEU (Western European Union) and Nato (North Atlantic Treaty\\nOrganisation). It is the Danish view that the common foreign and security\\npolicy should in principle extend to all aspects where unanimity can be\\nachieved among the member states. Military co-operation proper should be\\nundertaken within existing alliance structures with member states' present\\ndefence commitments being honoured. Member states should unanimously\\nestablish the common foreign and security policy.\\nDenmark and the UK share the view that, whatever the outcome of the\\nnegotiations, one thing will remain certain: without Nato, European defence\\narrangements would lack credibility, nor would they inspire confidence in\\nthe remaining part of Europe.\\nThe strength of the security glue, which for 40 years has kept western\\nEurope together, is being reduced. That is why we consider it a major goal\\nto avoid a re-nationalisation of defence policies in the new European\\nArchitecture.\\nEurope's voice in the New World Order should be strengthened - economically,\\npolitically and defence-wise. If we fail and leave a disproportion between\\nEurope's economic strength and its political resourcefulness, we would also\\nleave a Europe on dangerous tracks.\\nThe days are gone when it really made sense to talk about autonomy and\\nsovereignty. The issue before us is about pooling resources. By\\nstrengthening international co-operation you necessarily limit your room for\\nmanoeuvre - but also for making mistakes. To drive my point home: an\\neconomic and monetary union makes it impossible for a member state to pursue\\na high inflationary policy coupled with successive devaluations.\\nWe consider Emu a necessity. To some extent it is a natural consequence of\\nthe liberalisation of capital movements. We want to go ahead with the\\nproject after sufficient economic convergence has taken place, primarily\\nbecause you can reap all the benefits only in the third phase. Second,\\nbecause we want to have a say in the decisions which, in any case, set the\\nframework for our own national policies.\\nWhat does Europe really need then? We need the right blend of visions and\\nideas - of prudence and pragmatism. Ideas should be far-reaching, but not\\nout of step with reality. Otherwise they could backfire and create a\\ncredibility problem.\\nIt may seem odd to hear such words from a Danish foreign minister. After\\nall, we have for some years been seen as footdraggers in the Community. But\\nwe have reversed our policy. I admit it without hesitation. We have learned\\nsome lessons, and we consider it imperative to strengthen the Community in\\norder to create our New Europe in the New World Order.\"},\n",

It also saved Mr Gorbachev from serious challenge during\\nthe first day of a plenary meeting of the Communist Party's Central\\nCommittee, at which some hardliners were expected to press for his\\nresignation.\\nA joint statement, published yesterday after being signed on Tuesday night\\nby the two men and eight other leaders of Soviet republic, commits them to\\nan agreement on such a treaty, followed by a new constitution and fresh\\nunion elections, as soon as possible.\\nThe plan agreed yesterday would also explicitly allow the six other\\nrepublics - the three Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia plus\\nArmenia, Georgia and Moldavia - the right not to sign a union agreement.\\nThese republics were not represented at the meeting. The agreement in turn\\nimplies, although the phrasing is vague, that the six could instead proceed\\nto full independence.\\nThe statement warns that those republics would then be expected to settle\\ntheir accounts with the union in hard currency. Mr Yuri Kahn, Estonia's\\npermanent envoy to Moscow, welcomed the declaration as 'progress' even\\nthough it would mean paying more for energy and other supplies.\\n'Of course, economically it will be very difficult but it is a very\\nimportant step in the direction of a market economy. We understand that\\nsooner or later we must go to world market prices,' he said. Politically, it\\nhad the merit of recognising the Baltic states' 'legal right not to sign the\\nunion treaty'.\\nMr Gorbachev's coup in securing agreement on some of the most fundamental\\nissues facing the Soviet Union opens the possibility of further talks on a\\nnew form of government bringing in different political forces - or, as some\\npeople are calling for, a more powerful Federation Council uniting leaders\\nof the republics under Mr Gorbachev's chairmanship.\\nIt also suggests that the Soviet president is moving away from the hardline\\ncamp on whose support he has relied in recent months, back to an alliance\\nwith more radical forces. In so doing, he risks the wrath of groups such as\\nthe Soyuz faction in the union parliament, which has already called for a\\nspecial congress to review his performance. Mr Gorbachev got the agreement -\\npublished yesterday only in the late editions of Pravda, the organ of the\\nCommunist Party central committee - just as the central committee was\\ngathering for a plenary meeting at which hardliners had threatened to raise\\nthe issue of his future as general secretary.\\nFirst indications were that he had avoided any serious challenge. Members of\\nthe central committee said that specific motions to unseat him had been kept\\noff the agenda.\\nThe key to the agreement with the republics apparently lies in the final\\nparagraph which says that its signatories realise that 'these measures are\\ninconceivable without a fundamental increase in the role of the union\\nrepublics.'\\nA spokesman for the government suggested this would be achieved through\\neconomic agreements between the centre and republics.\\nThe anti-crisis programme spells out 10 types of economic agreement to be\\nconcluded with the republics, in areas ranging from price liberalisation and\\nprivatisation to the formation of the budget.\\nMr Yeltsin's press spokeswoman said that she believed the statement would\\nlead to the start of the 'round table' talks proposed by the Russian leader.\\nAt the same time, Mr Yeltsin has lent his authority to a call for an end to\\nstrikes and for 'strict compliance with current laws'; to a 'special regime'\\nof work in basic industries; and to a statement which characterised as\\n'intolerable' any attempts to attain political ends through 'incitement to\\ncivil disobedience, strikes or calls for the overthrow of the existing\\nlawfully elected state power bodies'.\\nIt was not clear last night whether the agreement would succeed in ending\\nthe current wave of strikes, in spite of Mr Yeltsin's considerable authority\\nover striking miners in the Russian Federation.\\nMeanwhile, the Soviet army appeared to be keeping up the pressure in\\nLithuania by taking over the Agro-Industrial Bank in Vilnius, the capital,\\nin spite of the start of talks between the central government and Lithuania\\nand promises by the Kremlin to resolve disputes by political means.\\nEditorial Comment, Page 20\"},\n",

Since the beginning\\nof 1990 it has fallen by almost 30 per cent.\\nHowever, the sick man of Asia now seems to be over the worst. It briefly\\nawoke from its lethargy on Tuesday, when the index jumped by 3.6 per cent;\\nand yesterday, when turnover climbed from Won142.3bn to Won180bn, investors\\nrevelled in their ability to take a profit. 'The question investors are\\nasking now is not 'should I sell?', but when should I start to buy?' says Ms\\nMelissa Brown, director of research at Barclays De Zoete Wedd in Seoul.\\nThe protracted gloom has been due to a combination of fundamental and\\ntechnical factors. Inflation, the resulting tightening of credit, and\\nconcern about the source of South Korea's growth have soured sentiment.\\nWhile GNP continues to expand at one of the highest rates in the world,\\nrising by 9 per cent last year, the pattern of growth has shifted\\ndramatically since 1987 and 1988. Exports, the traditional engine of the\\neconomy, grew by a meagre 3 per cent in 1989 and 1990, while consumption and\\nthe service sector have taken up the slack.\\n'There is a feeling that the source of growth is still not very healthy,'\\nsays Mr Torquil McAlpine, chief representative of Schroder Securities in\\nSeoul. 'Investment in manufacturing is still being crowded out.' Inflation,\\ntoo, is rearing its head again. In the first quarter of this year consumer\\nprices rose by 3.7 per cent, nearly half the government's target for the\\nyear.\\nIn an attempt to curb the spectre of double digit inflation, the government\\nhas tightened money. 'The credit crunch is beginning to bite,' says Mr Hank\\nMorris, chief representative of Kleinwort Benson. He adds that South Korean\\ncompanies are finding capital harder than ever to come by.\\nThe resulting liquidity constraint has created adverse technical factors.\\nWhen the market rallies, investors, and particularly securities companies\\nwhich are hardest strapped for funds, are tempted to sell. Consequently,\\nupturns have tended to be short-lived.\\nTrading, too, is subdued. Average daily turnover is in the region of Dollars\\n120m, about one quarter of the turnover in the salad days of 1989.\\nShafts of light, however, are now penetrating the gloom. Exports grew by an\\nencouraging 10.2 per cent in the first quarter, year on year, a trend which\\nis expected to be sustained by reviving economic growth in the US and much\\nof Europe, and by post-Gulf war reconstruction. Oil prices, critical to\\nSouth Korea's import-dependent energy sector, have also eased.\\nThe stabilisation fund, inspired by the government and set up by financial\\ninstitutions last year to support the ailing bourse, still has estimated\\nfree funds of over Won300bn (Dollars 413m) to stimulate a rally. In\\naddition, the prospect of direct foreign investment, to be allowed from next\\nyear, will create a boost even before the new capital arrives.\\nThat foreign interest exists is shown by the increased prices this year for\\nSouth Korean Euromarket instruments.

The\\nepicentre of the earthquake occured 40km south-east of the port.\\nDamage to bridges along the main highway to Puerto Limon 'may take a week to\\nrepair, but those to the south will take much longer as many have fallen\\ninto the rivers.

The margin refiners\\ncan claim over crude oil slipped to just Dollars 1 a barrel last week from a\\npeak of Dollars 11 in February when the Gulf war was still underway.\\nAs the strength in the market for refined products disappears, oil prices\\nare dropping quickly. While Saudi Arabia and Iran are not flooding the\\nmarket with crude from their floating stores, there is still some\\ncompetitive pressure between the two which could ease prices down.\\nThe oil market is currently searching for a direction and, if that direction\\nis not to be overwhelmingly downwards, there needs to be a substantial\\npick-up in demand or evidence of further production cutbacks.\"},\n",

After behind-the-scenes prodding by the Bank of\\nEngland, the options market and the London International Financial Futures\\nExchange took the plunge and announced last year that they would merge.\\nThis was greeted with a huge sigh of relief by options dealers who saw\\nmerger as the only hope for a market which has failed to compete with its US\\nand European counterparts. The hope was that the success of Liffe would rub\\noff on the options market.\\nSo the letter which options traders received this week from the LTOM and\\nLiffe boards will have come as nothing less than a tremendous bolt from the\\nblue.

We thought it would be five or 10 years\\nbefore stock options moved onto the screens,' said a manager of an\\nindependent options brokerage.\\nBut the speed with which LTOM is to be restructured is a reflection of the\\ndesperate state the options market has reached. The daily options turnover\\nis regularly less than the 30,000 contracts needed for LTOM to cover its\\ncosts and for brokers to break even.\\nA round of redundancies has just been completed at a number of leading\\nsecurities houses and yet costs are still out of control. Just yesterday,\\nHoare Govett announced it is to pull out of options market-making. The lack\\nof business leads to less competitive quotes for options and an irregular\\nupdating of prices, which in turn discourages investors.\\nAs one options executive said: 'The quality of prices leaves an awful lot to\\nbe desired. There are 2,500 options series but on average day just 32 are\\nupdated.'\\nMr Tony de Guingand, managing director of LTOM, and Mr Michael Jenkins,\\nchief executive of Liffe, believe that the openness of trading options\\ndiscourages investors. A broker who buys options is letting the whole market\\nknow he or she has a certain position and is then at the mercy of the market\\nwhen that trade needs to be unwound.\\nThe success of the Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures and options\\nmarket, and the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange, both of which\\nare screen-based, has encouraged LTOM into its own Big Bang.\\nHowever a number of uncertainties remain:\\nThe cost of entry into the new market. Sophisticated computer technology\\nwill be required and it is not clear whether smaller independent traders\\nwill be able to afford this.\\nWhether the new trading system will be a genuinely competitive market or\\nwill just display indicative prices for nominal amounts of options. The\\nproponents of the new scheme vow to avoid the Stock Exchange quote machines,\\nwhich suffer from these defects. But the suspicion remains that unless there\\nare safeguards and strict supervision the options market will become\\ndominated by a handful of large securities houses.\\nIf an anonymous market will actually encourage business. Larger institutions\\nsaid the current open outcry market rarely leads to them being caught out by\\nmarket-makers. As one fund manager who uses the options market said: 'Every\\nnow and again you have a problem when a trade is visible and it gets\\nspotted. But normally there is no problem.'\\nThe number of jobs under threat. Liffe and LTOM believe it may lead to an\\nexpansion in employment. On LTOM one person can make a market in up to five\\nstocks options. But screen-based systems need at least one market-maker per\\nstock and there are currently 72. However, if liquidity does not pick up,\\nthere could be a drastic reduction in the number of stocks that are\\neventually quoted. In any case, it seems certain that the floor brokers, who\\ncan deal on behalf of Stock Exchange members, are at risk. Unless they can\\nturn their hands to selling options, the 75 or so brokers would not appear\\nto have an optimistic future.\\nIn spite of these reservations most options traders do not see any\\nalternative to Liffe and LTOM's proposals and there seems little doubt that\\na screen-based system will emerge from the consultation of members that is\\nunder way.\\nMore importantly, the changes underline the dominance of Liffe in what looks\\nmore like a takeover than a merger. But if this increases London's\\nimportance in the growing European derivatives markets, the Bank of England\\nis unlikely to shed any tears for the open outcry market.\"},\n",

Over the past two years, Inter-Continental has\\nfailed to cover its financing costs, losing Dollars 60m in 1989 and running\\nsome Dollars 7m into the red last year.\\nBut the company points out that its projections made at the time of the\\npurchase were overtaken by rising world interest rates and, more recently,\\nby the impact of the Gulf crisis.\\nMr Yuji Takaoka, chairman of Seiyu, the trading company at the core of the\\nSaison group, insists that Inter-Continental's performance is satisfactory.\\nHe draws attention to the hotel chain's operating profits which grew 20 per\\ncent last year to Dollars 87.5m.\\nMr Takaoka expects the investment to pay off in the long run. 'For the first\\nfew years we have not set a prime goal of making profits. Of course, we\\ndon't want to see red ink. But rather than just achieve a big profit we want\\nto develop a good network.'\\nMr Takaoka denies suggestions that the Saison group's finances are being\\nstretched by the acquisition which was funded with bank borrowings totalling\\nmore than Dollars 1.2bn. 'Inter-Continental is not a burden,' he says,\\nadding that the hotel chain is expected to cover its interest payments and\\nmake a pre-tax profit in 1991.\\nSaison Group, which used to be called Seibu Saison until late last year, is\\none of the best-known companies in Japan, with a portfolio of high-profile\\nbusinesses and a colourful corporate history.\\nThe group is a network of 130 companies, including seven which are publicly\\nquoted, with interests ranging from Seibu Department Stores, Japan's biggest\\nchain, to helicopters, banking and travel. It is controlled by Mr Seiji\\nTsutsumi, whose brother Mr Yoshiaki Tsutsumi has an even larger business\\nempire based on railways. The two men, who inherited their fortunes from\\ntheir father, are said to be bitter rivals.\\nMr Takaoka says Saison companies are managed independently but co-operate on\\nlarge projects such as the purchase of Inter-Continental. The bulk of the\\nfinance for the deal was raised by the group's listed companies.\\nMr Takaoka concedes the increase in interest rates made the Japanese\\nfinancial markets 'very tight' and so made it more expensive than expected\\nto finance the purchase. Saison group originally intended to replace its\\nbank lending with long-term funds. But the difficulty of using the capital\\nmarkets obliged the group last year to extend its bank loans.\\nThe Japanese media say this arrangement also forced Saison group to revise\\nits plans for Inter-Continental to squeeze more profits out of the operation\\nin the next few years. According to Diamond Weekly, a business magazine,\\nthis will include more property sales than originally planned, among them\\nthe disposal of the Mayfair, in central London, one of Inter-Continental's\\ntop hotels.\\nMr Takaoka says financial projections have been revised but not by very\\nmuch. He declines to give figures. Also, far from selling hotels, Saison\\ngroup has expanded the Inter-Continental chain from 95 in 1988 to 102, plus\\nnine properties under construction. If hotels are sold in future it will be\\nto streamline the chain, not to raise funds.\\nAs for the Mayfair, which might be worth Dollars 400m, Mr Takaoka says the\\ngroup is only considering selling it because a 'very old friend' has offered\\nto buy it. If the Mayfair is sold, it would allow the London\\nInter-Continental Hotel to be refurbished.\\nMr Takaoka says that the disposals the group has made also show that critics\\nare wrong in claiming the original purchase price was too high. He says\\ntop-class hotel rooms in the US are now trading at Dollars 0.4m-Dollars 0.5m\\neach, compared with an average of Dollars 0.2m paid for Inter-Continental\\nHotels.\\nThe group wants Inter-Continental to be a 'European-style' chain, with a\\ngreater emphasis on individuality and personal service than is apparent in\\nlarge US-owned chains, says Mr Takaoka.\\nThe chain will also be developed inside Japan, starting with the opening of\\nan Inter-Continental in Yokohama in July.\"},\n",

The\\nCommission was in danger of turning the European single market into 'a\\nshifting marsh, open to all currents, with the two economic citadels of the\\nUS and Japan standing on either side,' he said.\\nThe link-up between Alcatel Alsthom and Fiat, one of Europe's biggest\\ncross-border deals to date, was announced in October. It was the first deal\\nto attract a full Commission inquiry under its six-month-old merger control\\nregulation. As such, it makes a discouraging test case for the way in which\\nthe Commission can be expected to use its new powers, said Mr Suard. The\\nFrench company will do its best to satisfy the Commission's demands, but Mr\\nSuard gave no guarantee that he would comply with all of them. This is among\\nseveral delays experienced by the complex deal, Mr Suard revealed yesterday.\\nAlcatel Alsthom and Fiat have agreed to postpone another part of the accord,\\nunder which the French partner would take control of Fiat's rail equipment\\ndivision, because they cannot agree on price. Nevertheless, Mr Suard\\nemphasised that he was satisfied with the general progress of the link-up.\\nThe main part of the complex deal, which came into effect a few weeks ago -\\ndelayed six months by the Commission inquiry, says Mr Suard - gives Alcatel,\\nthe French group's telecommunications unit, control of Telettra, Fiat's\\ntelecommunications business.\\nFiat, meanwhile, is waiting to take control of Alcatel Alsthom's car\\nbatteries business, once the Commission has pronounced on the impact on the\\nFrench market. Finally, the pair have agreed to exchange share stakes, with\\nFiat taking 6 per cent of Alcatel Alsthom and the French partner taking 3\\nper cent of Fiat.\\nsion about the telecommunications part of the accord was that Alcatel and\\nTelettra's Spanish subsidiaries together hold 80 per cent of the Spanish\\nmarket for transmission equipment. Alcatel is the European Community's\\nlargest supplier of telecommunications equipment, with 29 per cent of the\\nmarket.\\nThe Alcatel-Telettra merger could only be allowed, said the Commission, if\\nthey broke their shareholding links with Telefonica, the Spanish telephone\\noperator, which, like some of its equivalents around the world, likes to\\nkeep minority stakes in its main suppliers. The aim is to curb any\\ntemptation for Telefonica to give Alcatel and Telettra special treatment.\\nMr Suard said he was happy to buy Telefonica's shares in Telettra's Italian\\nand Spanish subsidiary, since that was part of the original Fiat agreement.\\nHowever he was less than keen on the Commission's demand that Alcatel buy\\nback the 21.14 per cent stake that Telefonica holds in the French group's\\nSpanish subsidiary.\\n'We are negotiating in good faith to do so, but we can only do it if the\\npurchase conditions are acceptable to us,' he said.\\n'If we cannot agree the price, there will be no acquisition,' said Mr Suard.\\nAlcatel Alsthom will not indicate what that price might be, though\\nTelefonica's books value its stakes in Alcatel Standard Electrica - the\\nFrench group's Spanish offshoot - and Telettra Espanola at Pta4.4bn (Dollars\\n40.5m). Telefonica is likely to argue that this is a fraction of their real\\nvalue.\\nMr Suard found the requirement to buy back Telefonica's stake in Alcatel's\\nSpanish unit all the more surprising given that Telefonica continues to hold\\nshares in the local subsidiaries of Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications\\ngroup, and AT&T of the US, both competitors of Alcatel, without being\\nchallenged by Brussels.\\n'We are all in favour of competition, but it must be balanced,' said Mr\\nSuard, normally known for his liberal economic views.\\n'Applying this requirement only to Alcatel sets up a strong distortion in\\nthe single market.'\\nMr Suard does not plan to contest the decision. However, his outburst does\\nshow that France's general unease over the application of EC competition\\npolicy has spilled over from the traditional wrangling over state subsidies\\ninto a new area for dispute; mergers.\"}]"
