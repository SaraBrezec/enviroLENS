       " 'FT911-12': \"FRESH indications of the depth of the UK recession, wavering optimism for\\nbase rate cuts this week and a poor lead from Wall Street all combined to\\nundermine the UK stock market yesterday.\\nPressure for a further reduction in base rates was increased by the news\\nyesterday that the monthly rise in domestic consumer borrowing was at a\\nsix-year low in March. However, last week's cautionary views on interest\\nrates from the Bank of England have cast uncertainty over hopes in the City\\nof London that UK base rates will be cut this Friday in the wake of the\\nexpected fall in the UK retail price index.\\nAttempts by the equity market to hold on to FT-SE 2,500, reached at the end\\nof last month, proved fruitless yesterday and the market closed 37.7 points\\ndown at 2,486.6. The final picture was exceedingly gloomy, with the London\\nmarket extending its losses to finish virtually at the day's low as Wall\\nStreet continued its overnight fall of 51 Dow points by losing a further\\n9.39 early in the new session.\\nConfidence was not helped at the close by sudden rumours that another large\\nrights issue is in the offing. Institutional coffers are beginning to feel\\nthe weight of a 1991 rights issue burden already approaching Pounds 4bn,\\nwithout including a substantial number of share placings.\\nIn the face of Wall Street's heavy setback on Friday night, the London\\nmarket opened 23 Footsie points off, quickly abandoning the FT-SE 2,500 mark\\nattained at the close of business on April 30. There was no significant\\nrecovery during the session but further losses were restrained at first by\\nthe relative absence of sellers and a FT-SE June futures contract which\\nmanaged to hold above 2,500 until late in the day. But losses in share\\nprices were rapidly extended in late trading as the big institutions backed\\naway from the stock market.\\nMarket volume, as recorded by a Seaq-traded shares total of 354.9m shares,\\nwas low, even by comparison with Friday's 423m figure. The institutions were\\nbelieved to be top slicing, selling a small part of their holdings in blue\\nchip stocks in the expectation that these shares will be bought back more\\ncheaply in the weeks ahead.\\nWeakness in oil shares set the trend for widespread losses among Wall\\nStreet-orientated stocks. The industrial blue chips featured falls in BOC,\\nBAT Industries, Reuters and ICI. However, share losses in the international\\nsector were mostly suffered early in the session and did not increase\\ndisproportionately after Wall Street opened lower; some analysts commented\\nthat this indicated that domestic factors were the most significant in the\\nmarket yesterday.\\nThe uncertain political scene in the UK, ahead of Thursday's by-election in\\nthe Monmouth constituency acted as a further discouragement to the big\\ninstitutions, which are increasingly of the view that there will be little\\nto attract them to the UK stock market until the third quarter of the year.\\nTrading specialists suggested yesterday that, with their cash holdings\\ndrained by rights issues, the institutions are now less willing to buy cheap\\nstock whenever the market gives ground. Some believe that fund managers may\\nwait until the FT-SE falls by a further 50 or more points before making\\nserious buying forays.\\nHowever, optimism for a further strong rise in the UK market over the next\\n12 months, perhaps to around FT-SE 2,750, remains undimmed.\",\n",

The premium of the June FT-SE 100 index over the spot index\\nnarrowed from 20 points to around 10 on selling by independent traders.\\nAt one stage, the futures market attempted to rally and succeeded in\\nwidening the gap over the share market to 20 points.

       " 'FT911-16': \"Farmers love government grants. But the flurry of urgent activity in recent\\nweeks to beat today's deadline for applications for grant aid to help set up\\nmachinery rings has been out of all proportion to their value. There are\\nmuch more significant reasons for farmers to co-operate in an effort to cut\\nthe capital costs of machinery. The ending of the modest Pounds 10,000 per\\nring grant payable over three years merely concentrated minds.\\nMachinery rings began in Germany about 25 years ago. Born out of hard times,\\nthey brought together groups of farmers in local areas who were prepared to\\nwork some of their machinery on other people's farms where the appropriate\\ntackle was worn out or did not exist. In other words, one member of a ring\\nmight provide the combine harvester and deal with the grain on a number of\\nfarms while another would bale the straw and yet another might plough and\\nplant all the land for the following year's crops.\\nRings formalised local arrangements of this kind which had been going on\\nbetween farmers in the same village for years and set standard charges for\\ngiven tasks. By broadening the area over which such arrangements operated,\\nit also gave members access to more specialised equipment. By employing a\\nmanager to co-ordinate the work it provided organisation and a guarantee of\\npayment to those who did the work.\\nToday, there are about 260 machinery rings in Germany and the idea has\\nspread to other European countries, especially Holland and France. There\\nwere no rings established in the UK, however, until 1987 after a visit to\\nGermany by a Scottish agricultural adviser who came home and enthused his\\nclients over the concept. Since then, 10 machinery rings have been set up in\\nScotland.\\nAlthough most are still developing and expanding, it is expected that the\\ntotal turnover of the Scottish rings this year will reach Pounds 2.5m.\\nMoreover, the single most successful Scottish group, with 220 members\\nalready, has a turnover in excess of Pounds 1m.\\nThe first English machinery ring was formed in Sussex and Kent only last\\nyear. Since then, 15 more have been established across the country. All have\\nor are hoping to qualify for the Pounds 10,000 grant, 25 per cent of which\\ncomes from the EC and 75 per cent from the UK government. The scheme is\\nadministered by Food From Britain. At least another two rings are thought to\\nbe in course of formation but they will almost certainly not meet today's\\ngrant deadline.\\nWithin four years, therefore, Britain has gone from no machinery rings to\\nclose to 30 and the majority of them have been set up during the last few\\nweeks. The ending of the grant had undoubtedly speeded their formation (it\\nhas been available since 1986) but Pounds 3,333 per year for three years\\nsplit be-tween perhaps 200-300 farmers is insufficient motivation on its own\\nfor what has happened.\\nThe plain fact is that the machinery ring is an idea whose time has now come\\nin the UK. To some extent there is an element of following fashion because\\nthe concept has received a great deal of publicity in recent months. The\\nmain reason for the rush of activity, however, is declining farm profits and\\nthe realisation by a growing number of farmers that they must cut their\\ncosts to survive in business.\\nOn average, the so-called 'variable costs' of running a farm - the money\\nspent on seeds, fertilisers, sprays and so on - amount to between 35 per\\ncent and 40 per cent of total costs. Fixed costs account for the remaining\\n60 per cent to 65 per cent and cover such things as labour, interest\\ncharges, power and machinery.\\nIn recent years, as margins have declined, some of these 'fixed costs' have\\nhad to become variable as numbers of farmworkers have diminished either\\nthrough natural wastage or redundancy and as assets have been sold to reduce\\nborrowings and, therefore, interest charges. Power costs are more difficult\\nto control in the face of fluctuating oil prices while real depreciation on\\nmachinery values can be horrendous.\\nIndeed, the depreciation rates typically used in farm accounts may well be\\ninsufficient to allow for the replacement of machines whose purchase prices\\ncontinue to rise with inflation.\\nAdd to that the fact that many farms are over-mechanised for the\\nunderstandable reason that farmers like to feel on top of any job, whatever\\nthe weather, and it is clear that economies in machinery costs are overdue\\nin the current financial climate.\\nThe machinery ring has obviously been recognised as a possible solution. For\\nPounds 50 per year membership charge and a modest purchase of share capital,\\na farmer can plug into a source of extra income or extra help, whichever he\\nprefers. Commission charges of 2 per cent are levied on both the demander\\nand the provider of the work to cover the costs of the co-ordinator and his\\ncomputer. Otherwise, the charges for work are set at similar rates to the\\nmost competitive contractors.\\nExperience shows, apparently, that most rings lose money in their first year\\nor two but that as the organisation develops and as members begin to review\\ntheir machinery replacement policies, the flow of work offered and done\\nbuilds up dramatically. Indeed, it is possible to foresee situations where\\nsome farmers decide to buy bigger machines than they can justify in order to\\nearn extra cash working on other members' farms. At the same time, other\\nfarmers may see opportunities to earn more money off the farm and be pleased\\nto pay a ring member to do most of his farm work.\\nThe pattern is already established in Germany, albeit on smaller farms than\\nare typical in the UK. It is yet another step towards the establishment of\\nsignificant numbers of part-time farmers in this country. In any event,\\nthose groups of farmers who have their machinery rings up and running are\\nconvinced that there is a potential for many more.\\nA couple of weeks ago, there was a meeting of machinery ring leaders at the\\nNational Agricultural Centre at Stoneleigh, in Warwickshire. They decided to\\nset up an Association of Machinery Rings to guide those who come after and\\nto lobby on behalf of members on such things as the presently-restricted use\\nof red, tax-free diesel fuel in tractors travelling more than 15 miles from\\ntheir home base. They see this as a possible inhibition to the efficient\\nworking of rings which may cover an area 30 to 40 miles wide.\\nThe success of the concept relies on the willing co-operation of farmers. In\\nthis country, agricultural co-operation, with a few notable exceptions, has\\nseldom succeeded beyond the first flush of enthusiasm. I believe this\\nmachinery ring version of co-operation will work. In any case, the other day\\nI signed up to join one.\",\n",

Ms\\nCairncross provides a checklist of a dozen suggestions for company chairmen,\\nstarting with 'put the most senior person possible in charge of\\nenvironmental policy'. Her arguments, which are those of a market economist,\\nseek at each point to attempt some measure of the costs as well as the\\nbenefits of a particular green policy.

She refers to botanists\\nwho develop non-timber products to demonstrate that rain forests standing\\ncan be worth more than rain forests destroyed.\\nAmong the many sources quoted is the Yale economist Professor William\\nNordhaus, who apparently accepts that the benefits of banning\\nchlorofluorocarbons, responsible for the hole in the ozone layer may\\noutweigh the costs. But the goal of stabilising carbon dioxide output in\\n2000 at 1990 levels is alleged to be more costly to achieve than would be\\nthe benefits of avoiding global warming. Ms Cairncross dutifully records\\nsome of the green challenges to the Nordhaus equation, but implies that even\\nif his sums are wrong his methodology has to be addressed.\\nThe question is, should it be? 'Ultimately, it is easier to think of\\nenvironmental issues in terms of ethics than of discount rates,' she writes.\\n'Most people feel comfortable with the idea that their descendants ought to\\nenjoy the same natural inheritance as they have themselves received.' She\\nmanages, nevertheless, to fill 256 pages of recycled paper with merciless\\nanalyses of every green proposition.\\nI would not, however, accuse her, or Mr Heseltine, of confusion. Just\\nbecause you are convinced of the imminence of catastrophe is no reason not\\nto do a few sums. Both the minister and the author accept the precautionary\\nprinciple - that in case the worst predictions are right it pays to do\\nsomething now.

It is part of everyday discourse, and subject\\nto its rigours. I believe that when the economy picks up, and perhaps\\nanother discovery takes us a few notches higher up the curve of fear, the\\ncosts of not protecting the future will loom larger, and professor\\nNordhaus's flawed equations will have to be re-worked.

The citizens' charter - more\\nappropriately a consumers' charter - would strengthen the consumer's voice\\nwith two innovations to mimic the relationship between buyer and seller in\\nmarket transactions.\\nThe first would create a contract between the service provider and the\\nconsumer which specified the services to be provided. Thus BR might make the\\ncommuter a range of promises on matters such as punctuality, cleanliness and\\nreliability of services. NHS patients could be guaranteed treatment within\\ntime limits which depended on the seriousness of the complaint. Council\\ntenants would be entitled to repairs within a specified period.\\nDirect redress\\nThis contract would be enforced by the consumer through the second\\ninnovation: simple and direct channels of redress. So there might be rebates\\nor discounts when a train was repeatedly cancelled. More radically, a\\nconsumer whose NHS operation was cancelled could be entitled to reasonable\\nreimbursement for the cost of private treatment (some local authorities\\nalready reimburse tenants for the cost of repairs in such circumstances).\\nSo far, so good, if a challenge to the imagination. But when it comes to the\\ndetails of how the charter would operate, substantive proposals are lacking.\\nFor a start, which services will be covered? It is hard to see the charter\\nhaving much to say about education, unless it offers to pick up the fees for\\nEton for parents let down by their local comprehensive. And what is to stop\\nmanagers re-organising services to avoid penalties, simply by sharing the\\nmisery around more equally?\\nThen there are the cost implications of compensating dissatisfied customers.\\nEven if redress is only in the form of modest cash payments (as BT now\\noffers when it fails to keep home appointments), the cost is born by other\\ncustomers either in higher charges or worse service. The costs become much\\nmore substantial if they empower the customer to claim back the cost of\\nprivate provision when the public service fails. For the NHS to make a\\nsimilar offer could lead to a rapid explosion of costs unless the service\\ntargets were so modest as to be empty.\\nConsumers' interests\\nConsumer empowerment needs more than just redress systems. The evidence\\nsuggests that only a small minority of consumers ever use such systems - and\\nthose in most need are often least able to do so. The achievement of the\\nregulators who oversee the newly-privatised utilities suggests a model for\\nadvancing the interests of consumers which could be extended to the public\\nservices, although a public service regulator could not use his private\\ncounterpart's most effective weapon - price restraint - in services which\\nare free at the point of consumption.\\nQuestions such as these do not present insuperable problems, but finding\\nanswers requires a willingness to confront hard issues. Some public services\\nare poor because they are badly managed: the citizens' charter could\\ncertainly encourage improvements. Others are underfunded, and a charter\\nwould only expose the low levels of service which have become the norm.\\nTo improve many of Britain's public services requires a combination of\\nconsumer power and extra investment. Charters alone will not guarantee the\\nimprovement in public services which all parties now seem committed to\\ndelivering in the 1990s.\",\n",

So far this\\nseason, despite rain and recession, attendance levels are 14 per cent higher\\nthan last year.\\nThe cinema is flourishing too, partly because of its appeal for the\\nunder-25s. Cinemas enjoyed their best year for a decade in 1990 with average\\nweekly admissions of 1.88m people. So far this year, they have fared even\\nbetter with average admissions of 1.94m a week in the first quarter.\\nBut pleasure beaches and cinemas are the exceptions. The worst-affected\\ncompanies are those catering for the 25 to 40-year-olds, the 'yuppies' of\\nthe 1980s, many of whom bought property near the peak of the housing market\\nand are now saddled with hefty mortgage repayments and credit card debt.\\nThe 'designer' shopping centres that opened in the 1980s, such as Tobacco\\nDock in east London, are littered with boarded-up windows. Restaurants are\\nsuffering too. Mr Alistair Little, who runs the eponymous restaurant in\\nLondon's Soho, first noticed the slowdown towards the end of last year. His\\nregulars have since been eating out less often and spending less on their\\nmeals.\\nCompanies linked to the housing market have also suffered. Home furniture,\\none of the first areas to be affected, saw sales fall by 6 per cent in real\\nterms to Pounds 4.7bn last year. This was devastating for Lowndes Queensway,\\none of the biggest furniture retailers which had just completed a Pounds\\n450m leveraged buy-out. Last summer, Lowndes called in the receiver.\\nIn general, the recession has accentuated the difference between the\\nstronger and weaker players. In the pubs market, Mr Peter Jarvis, chief\\nexecutive of Whitbread, one of the biggest brewers, has noted the difference\\nbetween 'good pubs in large premises with decent facilities' which are still\\ndoing well and the 'bad pubs in run-down areas' which are 'finding life very\\ndifficult'.\\nWhen the end of the recession comes into sight later this year, the critical\\nquestion for the consumer service sector is what its long-term consequences\\nwill be.\\nSome areas of consumer services are unlikely to return to their\\npre-recession buoyancy. The designer shops and expensive restaurants in the\\n'yuppie' market would probably have contracted even without the economic\\ndownturn. The self-indulgent young adults of the 1980s are now settling into\\nthe responsibilities of family life as they enter their 30s.\\nOther areas will return to growth once the economy recovers. In furniture\\nretailing, where rationalisation has been severe - the number of stores has\\nfallen by 600 to about 14,000 in the past five years - there is sure to be\\nscope for re-investment.\\nThe established companies, such as Magnet and MFI, are so burdened by debt\\nthat new investors may move into the market. Argos, the catalogue retailer,\\nhas been studying furniture retailing for several years and now plans to\\nopen four stores. Ikea, the Swedish group which already owns three UK\\nfurniture stores, plans to accelerate its expansion by opening up to 15\\nstores by the mid-1990s.\\nIn other markets such as pubs, where rationalisation has been less intense,\\nthe recession has tended to accelerate existing trends. The brewers have\\nspeeded up the process of closing down their smaller, scruffier pubs in\\nfavour of concentrating investment on more promising premises. Whitbread\\nshut 350 of its 6,650 pubs last year and spent Pounds 250m on new pubs and\\nrestaurants such as Wayside Inns, its upmarket traditional country pubs.\\nBut all consumer service companies face the challenge of getting to grips\\nwith the long-term changes in the marketplace.\\nOne important issue is the change in demographics: the decline in the number\\nof teenagers and the corresponding growth of the elderly population. This\\nposes obvious problems for businesses like fashion shops and theme parks\\nthat depend on the teenage market.\\nBurton, which owns the Top Shop teenage fashion chain, is in the middle of a\\nstrategic review of all its operations. Sears, which owns Miss Selfridge and\\nDolcis, is reshuffling its retail portfolio. The focus of its investment is\\nnow on 'family' concepts such as Adams children's wear shops and the Olympus\\nsports chain.\\nAlton Towers, the Staffordshire theme park owned by Pearson (which owns the\\nFinancial Times), is concentrating its investment on enhancing its appeal to\\nfamilies. In the past, it has relied on 'white knuckle' rides to attract the\\nthrill-seeking under-25s (who represented two-thirds of its 2m visitors last\\nyear). It is now spending Pounds 6m on two new family rides - the Haunted\\nHouse and Runaway Mine Train - in the hope of attracting more family groups\\nto lessen the blow of the shrinking teenage market.\\nDemographic changes will also intensify the financial pressure on the\\nsector, notably on retailers and fast food chains, which have traditionally\\ndepended on a regular influx of teenage employees on low wages.\\nThese companies are already examining alternatives. McDonald's, the fast\\nfood group, is developing a programme for part-time managers so some\\nemployees, notably women with children, can return to work after career\\nbreaks. It is also recruiting older managers who have spent most of their\\ncareers in other industries.\\nThe shortage of teenage recruits will almost certainly force companies to\\noffer higher pay, thereby increasing overheads at a time when they already\\nface rising property costs due to rent and rate reviews, like those on South\\nMolton Street.\\nDemographic and financial pressures aside, the chief challenge for the\\nservice sector is to respond to the continuing demand from consumers for\\nhigher quality in terms of products and service. This was one of the main\\ntrends of the 1980s and has continued, despite the recession, as the pattern\\nof trading in pubs suggests.\\nIn some markets, the drive towards higher quality means the successful\\ncompanies will be those that continually invest in improving their products.\\nThe brewers will carry on upgrading their pubs. A recent study by the\\nBrewer's Society suggested that as many as 8,000 of Britain's 80,000 pubs\\nwill close over the next decade so the brewers can concentrate resources on\\ntheir larger, more modern pubs.\\nSimilarly, food retailers will continue the process of closing their old\\nsupermarkets to concentrate investment on new superstores, the giant stores\\nselling everything from avocados to ankle socks.\\nM and S, which already runs eight edge-of-town clothing and food stores,\\nplans to open up to 25 over the next few years. Tesco has identified 200\\nprospective sites, many of which will be superstores. However, Sir Ian\\nMacLaurin, Tesco's chairman, said it also plans to stay in the high street\\nby developing 'high-quality neighbourhood stores'.\\nIn other markets, the quality trend could create opportunities for\\nexpansion. These will be the less 'mature' markets, such as restaurants and\\nhotels, that have been constrained by the comparatively unsophisticated\\ntaste of British consumers. The British undoubtedly became more cosmopolitan\\nduring the 1980s but most Britons have never tasted pizza and still stay at\\nhome for their holidays.\\nThis means that companies like Forte, the hotel group, can expect to expand\\nby 'converting' new consumers, in its case the people who do not usually\\nstay in hotels. One of Forte's most successful concepts is the five year-old\\nTravelodge budget chain.\\nTravelodge, which offers a standard package of a double room for the fixed\\nprice of Pounds 29.95, is designed for the leisure travellers who cannot\\nafford luxury hotels but are wary of the poor facilities in bed and\\nbreakfasts. There are now 81 Travelodges. Forte plans to open 40 a year at\\nleast until 1995.\\nForte may be right and the British will have become converts to hotel\\nholidays - and pizza eating - by the end of the 1990s. But in the meantime,\\nForte, South Molton Street and the rest of the consumer service sector face\\nat least another six months of financial pressure as they wait for the end\\nof the recession.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-56': \"'My subject is War, and the pit of War' wrote Wilfred Owen in 1918, just\\nbefore he was killed. David Smith's 'Medals for Dishonor' are about anger,\\nas well as pity, anger against warmongers and the exploiters of the\\ndefenceless. Smith is best known in this country as a welder of large\\nabstract sculptures in stainless steel. The Tate Gallery owns a fine 'Cubi'\\nof 1964, now augmented, thanks to a generous loan by his daughters of two\\nearlier, more figurative sculptures. Again, thanks to the family, we can now\\nsee the extraordinary series of fifteen bronze reliefs which he made between\\n1937 and 1940 at the Imperial War Museum, brilliantly displayed in glass\\ncabinets.\\nUnlike his contemporary American abstract expressionists, Smith travelled\\nwidely in Europe in 1935-36, ending up in Britain. He was a violent opponent\\nof rising Fascism in Germany and Italy, and his awareness of the Spanish\\nCivil War was strengthened by seeing Picasso's 'Guernica' when it was\\nexhibited in New York. The specific impetus for the Medals was a visit to\\nthe British Museum in May, 1936, where he saw a display of First World War\\nmedals by German and French artists. He was especially drawn to the savage\\npropaganda of the German medals, which he related to the disintegrating\\npolitical situation in America.\\nSmith's targets were politicians, diplomats, the press (in particular,\\nWilliam Randolph Hearst), the clergy and what he called 'War Exempt Sons of\\nthe Rich,' whose medallion has a Greek inscription translating as 'soft\\ncookies' across the centre. The imagery is strongly influenced by European\\nSurrealism, especially Dali, and he borrows Picasso's symbolic use of the\\nbull to represent the 'disemboweller of the lie of Franco.' Smith also\\nquotes from Goya's 'Disasters of War' and draws on the apocalyptic language\\nof paintings by Bosch and Breughel. The medallions were made with extreme\\ndifficulty, using dentists' and jewellers' tools on hard dental stone.\\nSmith's anger seems quite literally to bubble through the surface. The first\\n(and only, as it turned out) edition was cast in bronze and exhibited in\\n1940 to a distinct lack of acclaim. Since none was sold, they have remained\\nin the family and are now exhibited with related drawings. Taken together,\\nthe ferocious anti-war and anti-corruption statements which they make are as\\nrelevant today as they were then. (Until June 23).\\n*****\\nDenis Masi is also concerned with the machinery of conflict, with man's\\nnever-ending desire for territorial expansion at the expense of the weak,\\nwith paraphernalia of domination which includes imprisonment and\\nsurveillance. Masi's concepts are based on issues and polemics, which until\\nrecently have been more appropriately displayed as installations in public\\nplaces. With the new wall work, Masi has come off the street and into two\\ngalleries, Edward Totah and Anderson O'Day. Although he has moved away from\\ninstallations, the work has lost none of its impact. Elegant and beautifully\\ncrafted, Masi's wall pieces lie in wait, crouched by sleek feline creatures,\\nwaiting to pounce on the imagination.\\nThe smoothly finished weld mesh and copper cladding of 'Border No. 3' does\\nnot conceal that it is about territory, both physical and psychological,\\nwhether it be Northern Ireland, Kuwait or Kurdistan. The searchlight,\\ndescribed as a found object, in 'Make It Known,' speaks volumes to the\\ncollective memory of watchtowers at Buchenwald or Long Kesh. Many of the\\npieces include a mirror, which gives the viewer back his own image and,\\ninserted into oxydised copper, as a narrow, horizontal strip behind a weld\\nmesh cage, must also be understood as an observation device. Either way, the\\nviewer is drawn into complicity with the artist. 'Territorial Imperative,'\\nincorporates corrugated steel, a flue and louvers. Uneasily, we wonder\\nwhether we are in a mortuary or a hospital, the flue perhaps an escape route\\nfor smoke from a crematorium. (Until May 25.)\\nFar removed from politics and the sturm und drang of warring nations are\\nLucy Jones's rapturous paintings of her native city at the Flowers East\\ngallery. Born and bred in London, she celebrates its buildings and monuments\\nin dazzling colours. Not since Derain, in imitation of Monet, was sent here\\nby his dealer in 1905 has London been recorded with such panache. Like Monet\\nand Derain, Jones is magnetised by the river. Drawn to it repeatedly, she\\npaints it in a variety of moods and colours; the dolphins on the lamp-posts\\nalong the embankment take on a vigorous life of their own, here green and\\nred, there purple and brown.\\nBuses and cars lollop round Trafalgar Square like Dinky toys or hurtle\\ntowards Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Jones's rainbow-hued London is\\nthe city of her mind, bearing little relation to the archetypal grey, wet\\nSaturday afternoon. Her self-portraits are a new avenue down which she has\\nraced full tilt, revelling in the permutations of colour contrast: Van Gogh\\nsunflower yellow is the background for the violet-clad artist in the\\nfull-length portrait, 'All of Lucy Jones.' (To May 26.)\\n*****\\nLaura Ford's paintings and sculptures at Benjamin Rhodes Gallery have a\\nsuperficial look of innocence, which proves to be entirely false. Little\\ngirls, dressed in neat embroidered pinafores, stand atop full mountains of\\nfoam cushions. Their childish appearance is subverted by a menacing pair of\\npistols, whilst in place of a head there is a tangled mass of Gorgon locks\\nor a bursting flower. Surrealism is disturbingly mixed up with nursery rhyme\\nillustration, more Struwelpeter than Kate Greenaway. Far from being a Teddy\\nBears' Picnic, the painting 'Shagpile' looks more like a gang-bang or ritual\\nslaughter. Ford's declared liking for the sinister cautionary tales of\\nPatricia Highsmith is made visible in her frightening and unpleasant\\nsubtext. (To June 8.)\",\n",
       " 'FT911-57': \"After having seen the first part of Same Old Moon at the re-opening of the\\nOxford Playhouse last month, one went to its arrival in London with the\\nheart somewhere between the knees and the boots. Yet it is amazing what hard\\nwork and a better stage can bring. This is not another Dancing at Lughnasa,\\nand not only because Geraldine Aron does not write as well as Brian Friel -\\nit would be hard to do that. Ms Aron's piece also lacks the imagination and\\nthe ability to create a world on its own that are so conspicuous in Dancing.\\nBut, seen at the Globe, it is not a bad play.\\nThe Oxford theatre is cramped and box-like, perhaps fatally so. The Globe\\nhas space enough to illustrate the title. The moon shines on Dublin, Galway,\\nLondon and such faraway places as Rhodesia (as Zimbabwe then was) and\\nAustralia. The question is whether it is always the same moon. One answer is\\ngiven by the Irish barman who turns on the wireless and hears of the\\nJapanese attack on Pearl Harbour. 'Always the same old news,' he says in\\ndisgust as he turns it off. In other words, it depends on the way you look\\nat it.\\nBrenda, now beautifully played by Gabrielle Reidy with a confidence that the\\nsame actress did not have in Oxford, is catholic, Irish, and wants to get\\naway and write. She has a father who appears to dislike her. Almost on his\\ndeathbed he confesses it is because they are too similar. He admires her,\\nhowever, because unlike him she does not think that it is always the same\\nold moon. She goes off and does things.\\nThe play has some strong vignettes. A nun demonstrates to Brenda the act of\\nprocreation with a phallus-shaped biscuit and a doughnut. Brenda exchanges\\none of her first kisses in return for a ride on a bicycle: it is the bicycle\\nthat gets bent and broken. Best of all is the letter from the Vatican in\\nresponse to Brenda's appeal to the Pope. It is signed by Monsignor Flaherty\\nwho adds in brackets 'formerly Martin Flaherty' of a road in Galway.\\nThere are also some cliches: too many attempted jokes about sex and\\ncatholicism. It is not particularly funny that Brenda's father (played by\\nJames Ellis and looking curiously like Sir Bernard Ingham) should adopt all\\nthe prejudices of an Alf Garnett when he arrives in London, complaining\\nabout Pakistanis running the hospital and Jews running the country. A\\nlongish sequence which is devoted to what happens to women when they start\\nwearing a dressing gown must have been played at least a dozen times before,\\nthough I suppose it has a twist at the end: it is the fear of the same old\\ndressing gown that spurs Brenda on again.\\nFor my taste it is too Irish, sentimental and maudlin, but others may well\\nlike it and Jenny Killick's direction has improved beyond measure since\\nOxford.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-58': \"To kill your wife in a shooting accident is one thing; to turn the episode\\ninto a musical would seem, gall aside, to invite theatrical fiasco in the\\nworst of taste. Add lyrics that slide between German and English, a set that\\ncrosses von Sternberg with a western, rock music with fairground honky-tonk,\\nand disaster looks assured.\\nSo it is with reluctant but moonstruck admiration that I report The Black\\nRider (text: William Burroughs) as the star of the Berlin Theatre Festival\\n(to May 20) and one of the most delightful, inventive, profound and\\noriginally musical musicals composed; a fitting - self-consciously so -\\nsuccessor to those other mythical English-German concoctions, The Threepenny\\nOpera and Cabaret.\\nThe Black Rider overlays the modern legend of Burroughs, the Beatnik junkie\\nwho shot his wife, with the old tale of the village clerk who has to pass\\nmuster as marksman before he can marry the gamekeeper's daughter. He makes a\\npact in 'silver bullets' with the devil but on his wedding day Satan betrays\\nhim and he shoots dead not the targetted white dove but his wife. This was\\nthe story, converted to a happy ending, of Weber's Der Freischutz. Now\\nBurroughs, the Texan director and stage designer Robert Wilson, and rock\\ncomposer Tom Waits, have reworked the original into a contemporary version.\\nOther myths get woven in. Wilson's devil is a sleek Master of ceremonies in\\nwhiplash tails who croons the Cabaret welcome 'So come on in/it ain't no\\nsin/take off your skin/and dance around in your bones'. He introduces the\\ncast, his 'devil's band', as they step one by one out of a black felt\\nsentry-box.\\nFor three hours of graceful, cold artifice, they look, act and sound like\\nfigures from the silent movies: movements abrupt, irregular, too fast, too\\nslow, as if wound up by a shaky hand projector; chalk-white, bony faces,\\nblackened eye sockets, lips thickened into permanent red pouts. Every image\\nis ice-hard: hair pulled back crisp or standing up in spikes, clothes\\nexaggerating bodies with jagged collars, razor pleats, square and\\nrectangular dresses.\\nThe set continues the theme; Wilson turns children's drawings into\\nthree-dimensional monstrosities. Crooked chairs, two metres high, dangle at\\nodd angles along with a huge frame whose broken glass juts into the flesh of\\nits 'living' picture, the gamekeeper's ancestor (Heinz Fossbrink). Pine\\ntrees are scissor cut-outs which collapse and grow again like cartoons,\\nilluminated sugar pink and lime green against a black forest. Large or small\\nscale, Wilson is a master of spectacle: the clerk William and his Katchen\\nfloating above the stage for a duet as the great neon sign of a gun descends\\nbefore them; the white stockinged leg in red stiletto that appears out of a\\nslit in the black sentrybox, image of naivety, severity, brittle romance.\\nBest of all, the whole, the sustained dramatic unity of the vision, is\\ngreater than the sum of its parts. Tom Waits' sarcastic ballads, full of\\nfolk and blues and rock, call back the scarred idealism and mock simplicity\\nof Kurt Weill, while Burroughs' monosyllabic banality has here found the\\nsetting which makes it seem perfect.\\nNursery rhyme humour marries English with German, while Hollywood kitsch\\nrolls into Teutonic romanticism. Wilson's cast bop and strut and beat out\\nthe mesmeric rhythms in husky tempting voices. The devil (Dominique Horwitz)\\nhas the best tunes, and mocks us for loving them. In 'Last Rose of Summer'\\nhe picks a flower from the floor, affects a tear, disappears into his box\\nand, inside it, hovers up to the roof of the stage.\\nAnnette Paulmann and Stefan Kurt, as Katchen and William, screech like\\nvultures and sing like angels.

       " 'FT911-59': \"Until a year ago, London-based chartered accountants Touche Ross had just\\ntwo choices when it wanted to computerise the process of auditing its 1,500\\nclients.\\nFirst Touche could write its own software from scratch - or employ a\\ncontractor to do it - which could prove costly and time-consuming.\\nAlternatively, Touche could buy a standard software package and try to\\nadjust the way the firm operated in order to make the auditors' practices\\nfit the format of the software.\\nNeither option proved attractive: there was a dearth of readily available\\naudit support software and the firm was cautious about embarking on a big\\nsoftware applications drive. Because the bulk of audits are carried out\\nbetween November and April - for companies which report their year-ends in\\nDecember or March - Touche had to be sure that the software could be\\nimplemented in the slack summer period.\\n'If we missed that window we were another year away,' relates Mark Stephens,\\npartner for information technology at Touche. 'Something that took 13 months\\nto develop was really a two-year programme for us.'\\nAdvised of its imminent arrival, Stephens decided instead to wait for the\\nWindows 3.0 software program, launched a year ago this month by Microsoft,\\nthe leading US personal computer software company.\\nThe initial success of Windows 3.0 - nearly 3m copies of the program have\\nbeen sold worldwide - has been generated because it radically alters how\\nIBM-compatible personal computers can be used, giving them the look and feel\\nof an Apple Macintosh.\\nBut more sophisticated users of Windows 3.0, such as Touche, believe its\\nlong-term popularity will be rooted in the ability it gives software\\ndevelopers to customise their own packages more quickly. 'It takes a third\\nto a quarter of the time to produce sophisticated software than before,'\\nsays Stephens.\\nWindows 3.0 is a 'graphical user interface', a program that generates menu\\nbars, icons and overlapping windows, which can be used with various\\napplications programs such as word processing or spreadsheets. The interface\\nenables users to point at symbols and click an electronic 'mouse' to select\\nfunctions, instead of typing commands on a keyboard.\\nWhat makes Windows 3.0 useful to software developers is that it provides a\\n'programming environment' which sits on top of the applications package and\\nenables the procedures within the standard package to be adapted to the\\nneeds of the user organisation. Certain procedures can be ordered in a\\ndifferent way or eliminated if they are irrelevant.\\n'In the past we developed word processing packages on the basis of what we\\nthought users wanted, but you couldn't change them to fit in with the work\\npattern that you had in the office,' says David Smith, systems marketing\\nmanager for Microsoft. 'In trying to be general, and develop a package for\\nevery single user in the world, you had to compromise along the way.'\\nStephens and his team decided to use Microsoft's Word word-processing\\npackage running under Windows 3.0 as the basis for their development\\nprogramme. 'Auditing is a lot about writing but I didn't want to develop a\\nnew word processor. However we couldn't use a standard word processing\\npackage - we needed to tailor it to our specific application,' recalls\\nStephens.\\nSo they adapted the Word software, using Windows, to make it look like an\\nauditing tool. 'From an underlying software standpoint about 95 per cent of\\nthe software is Microsoft. We've done about 5 per cent,' says Stephens. But\\nhe reports that from a user point of view about 80 per cent of software\\nappears to be a specifically designed for auditing.\\nThe Touche software developers have achieved this by taking all the\\nword-processing features available in the Word package and linking them\\ndifferently. On top of that they have created headings and formats\\nspecifically for their auditors' needs. The progression on standard forms\\nand layout, for example, mirrors the procedures an auditor would follow in\\nthe course of his job - whether auditing banks or grocery stores.\\nAlthough the first software package, launched on 600 machines in August\\n1990, concentrated on the presentation of the software, this summer\\nStephens's department will be adding to the basic features and contributing\\nto the content of the application. One thing the development team will be\\nlooking at is making the existing software easy to translate - Touche's\\nParis office has already shown an interest in going down the same\\ndevelopment route.\\nBecause the development cycles are so short, Touche has even been able to\\ncreate several prototype applications and, once appropriate software has\\nbeen selected, the rest have been thrown away.\\nStephens points out that in spite of the moves towards these programmable\\napplications packages, the basic applications tools are not completely\\nready. Of the five common applications that can be used by most\\norganisations - word processing, spreadsheet, database, communications and\\ngraphics - Microsoft has developed only two to run under Windows 3.0 -\\nExcel, the spreadsheet package, and Word. It has also adapted Project, for\\nproject management.\\nBut the success of Windows has persuaded all the large applications software\\nhouses to adapt their most popular packages which run under Dos - the widely\\nused PC operating system - so that they can take full advantage of Windows.\\nLotus, for example, is in the final stages of developing a version of its\\npopular 1-2-3 spreadsheet package which will fully exploit Windows 3.0, and\\nis planning to have business graphics for the operating program later this\\nyear, says Robert Ingram, spreadsheet sales and marketing manager for the\\ncompany. Borland International has three programming tools which work with\\nWindows 3.0, and is also adapting its Paradox relational database package\\nand its Quattro Pro spreadsheet program.\\nMicrosoft estimates that there are now more than 700 software developers\\nwriting new Windows-based applications, all hoping to take a bite of an\\never-growing cherry. The Software Publishers Association in the US estimates\\nthat worldwide sales of Windows 3.0 applications are now second only to\\nthose of Dos applications packages. Market research consultant Dataquest\\nunderlines this optimism: it estimates that by 1992 systems sales of Windows\\nwill have overtaken those of Dos.\\nThe growth in the number of packages to run with Windows 3.0 has changed the\\nbuying patterns of Windows users, says Smith. 'For the first six or seven\\nmonths there was an enormous growth in the sales of Windows operating\\nsoftware. But for the last five months we have seen applications sales shoot\\nup - sales have quadrupled. Now 85 per cent of Windows users have a Windows\\napplication,' he says.\\nInitially Windows 3.0 customers were running their existing Dos programs\\nwith the operating system - giving them the advantage of the icon-type\\npresentation but without the power to move in and out of the applications\\nprovided by Windows 3.0. With Dos programs the user is forced to follow a\\nseries of commands in order to move through the program - like boring a\\nhole, which you have to climb back out of before you can begin boring\\nanother hole.\\nThe Windows icons enable users to jump between different applications. So\\none advantage of combining a Windows application with the Windows 3.0\\nprogram, says Smith, is that the user can take text, graphics or numbers\\nfrom one applications package and transfer them into another - figures from\\na spreadsheet program can be copied into a report being prepared in a word\\nprocessing package, say.\\nPerhaps the biggest advantage is that the two application packages need not\\neven be provided by the same software companies.\",\n",

       " 'FT911-65': \"WHEN politicians begin to argue about the relative merits of lower taxes or\\nhigher public spending it is time for the voters to beware. When the debate\\ntakes place in the approach to a general election and becomes enmeshed in\\nthe detail of supposedly incontrovertible arithmetic the most sensible\\ncourse for the uncommitted is to suspend belief.\\nThe real political - and economic - arguments behind the relative stances of\\nthe Tories and Labour party in the past week have been drowned in a sea of\\nirreconcilable and often spurious statistics.\\nAt one level there is no fundamental disagreement between the parties that\\nif the economy grows and tax rates remain constant, the government will reap\\na 'growth dividend'. It can spend it in one of three ways, or in any\\ncombination of the three: to reduce borrowing, to increase spending, and to\\nreduce tax rates.\\nThe Conservative policy is based on delivering a combination of all three.\\nIt says it will continue to provide real increases in resources for the\\npublic sector, will move towards a balanced budget, and will find room to\\ncut the basic rate of income tax.\\nLabour has said it will use the dividend to boost spending and it will\\ndefinitely not cut tax rates. It has been silent on whether it would reduce\\nborrowing or keep it at present levels.\\nIts only costed spending commitments - to increase child benefit and raise\\nstate pensions - will be financed separately by abolishing the ceiling on\\nemployees National Insurance Contributions and by increasing the top rate of\\nincome tax to 50p from 40p.\\nBut if that sounds a relatively straightforward choice as between Labour and\\nthe Conservatives, a dispassionate observer of the claims and counterclaims\\nflung across the party divide in recent days could draw only one conclusion:\\nour political masters canp. There have been many examples, but one or two\\ngive some of the flavour.\\nIn the middle of last week Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, declared that\\non the basis of growth of 2.5 per cent a year his party could expect a\\n'dividend' of about Pounds 20bn to devote to public services over the\\nlifetime of a parliament. The Conservatives seized on the figure as a\\n'gaff'. Their own spending plans already included provision for an extra\\nPounds 26bn in the next three years. If Labour was to spend Pounds 20bn more\\nit would have to raise taxes.\\nIt was a credible, if contentious point but the Conservatives then spoilt\\nthe case with their own arithmetic.\\nTheir charge was that Labour would have to raise the basic rate of income\\ntax by 2p each and every year for the lifetime of a parliament, pushing the\\nbasic rate of income tax to 35p. They omitted to mention that this would\\nraise not Pounds 20bn but Pounds 60bn. The message yesterday was that Mr\\nJohn Major, who first used the 10p figure, had made the 'reasonable'\\nassumption that Mr Kinnock had been talking about Pounds 20bn a year in\\nextra spending by the end of a parliament.\\nLabour meanwhile has been busy making its own assumptions about the\\nConservatives' plans. The strategy behind its weekend charge that Mr Major\\nhad a hidden agenda to raise Value Added Tax from 17.5 per cent to 22 per\\ncent in order to finance cuts in the basic rate of income tax was clear.\\nThe government has raised VAT twice since 1979 to finance reductions in\\nincome tax and, more recently, to reduce poll tax bills. Since its own\\nfigures showed there was no room in the next three years to reduce the basic\\nrate of income tax, Labour felt able to claim that it was obvious VAT would\\nrise again.\\nMr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, was careful, however, not to mention\\nany of the caveats with which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has\\ncircumscribed the income tax commitment. A rise in VAT of 4.5 per cent would\\nraise Pounds 8bn a year, enough to cut 4p off the basic rate of tax in the\\nfirst budget of a new Conservative government.\\nMr Lamont has stressed, however, that he plans to move towards his target at\\nan altogether more sedate pace.\\nEven if the politicians did not misinterpret their opponents' intentions,\\nthe apparent precision of their figures bestows a spurious accuracy on\\neconomic forecasts stretching five years ahead. The Treasury has shown in\\nthe past few years that it is dangerous to trust predictions stretching just\\n12 months ahead.\\nThe debate of the last few days does tell the voter that taxes are likely to\\nbe lower under the Conservatives and public spending higher under Labour.\\nBeyond that the forecasts are perhaps best regarded with the same confidence\\nas the average horoscope.\",\n",

The American Midwest, of which Chicago is the\\nfinancial and industrial capital, is weathering the current US recession\\nrelatively painlessly.\\nThe secret to the Midwest's success is not that it is enjoying a miraculous\\nrenaissance but that it did most of its hurtful shrinkage and\\nbelt-tightening in the early and mid-1980s.\\nWhile regions such as New England were revelling in 1980s booms, the Midwest\\nwas becoming 'slimmer and grimmer', says Mr Haskell Benishay, professor of\\nmanagerial economics at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of\\nManagement. Or as the refrain among Midwest economic analysts goes, 'No\\nboom, no bust.'\\nThe US recession of 1981 prompted a significant cut in Midwestern productive\\ncapacity and a higher technology retooling. In addition, the farming sector\\nhas emerged from a mid-1980s agricultural slump competitively leaner and far\\nless in debt.\\nSeveral key factors are involved in allowing the Midwest to ease through the\\nAmerican economic downturn, including the relative health of the property\\nmarket, a boost of exports helped by a lower valued dollar, and the\\nattraction of investment to the region, in particular by the Japanese.\\nWhile there is some weakness in the Midwest property market, it is doing\\nbetter than other American regions. Midwestern housing did not appreciate in\\nthe 1980s; now there is an incipient housing pick-up.\\nAccording to Commerce Department figures, Midwestern housing permits rose 14\\nper cent in March compared with December last year. February housing starts\\nwere up 77 per cent on January's levels.\\nRegional home values actually rose last year and are even expected to\\noutperform other parts of the country during the 1990s, according to Ms\\nDiane Swonk, regional economist for the First National Bank of Chicago.\\nThe declining trend in the US dollar has buoyed Midwestern exports and\\nforeign sales. US capital goods exports hit a record high in the fourth\\nquarter of 1990 and much of America's capital goods production is\\nconcentrated in the Midwest, according to Mr John Silvia, chief economist\\nfor Kemper Financial Services.\\nWhile there are no good statistics on regional exports, the state of\\nIllinois said its exports increased last year by 24 per cent and state\\nofficials expect these to rise again this year by 12 per cent.\\nChicago area-based Illinois Tool Works saw foreign sales jump to 50 per cent\\nof its total of Dollars 2.54bn (Pounds 1.47bn) last year. Although ITW\\nproduces much of what it sells overseas at its plants abroad, the 1990\\nportion of its foreign sales was double what it was five years ago, said Mr\\nW. H.

But the industry is both the blessing and\\nthe curse of the region.\\nIt provides many well-paid manufacturing jobs; but its cyclical nature, with\\nthe concomitant problems of unemployment and drops in local consumer\\nspending, is a big disadvantage.\\nThe large number of recent plant closures by Detroit's Big Three car-makers\\nhas hurt the Midwest in particular, and more pain is forecast because of\\ncontinuing industry overcapacity. The Japanese transplants have, however,\\nhelped offset the regional job losses. And, even with a slack US car market,\\ntheir plans to export Japanese cars to Europe promise to help keep them\\nrunning at capacity.\\nThe best-laid export plans may, however, be spoiled if the dollar continues\\nits recent upward path. But with respect to domestic-destined industrial\\nproduction, the Midwest has been lucky never to have become heavily\\ndependent, as have other areas, on defence spending. The pull-back in\\ndefence spending has hit other regions, such as New England and the west,\\nfar harder.\\nThe Midwest will, however, have to cope with some serious problems ahead:\\nits infrastructure is ageing; its population is declining; its foreign trade\\ncould become uncompetitive as the dollar shifts and other regions re-tool\\nwith more advanced technology. The free trade agreement with Mexico could\\nalso further siphon off manufacturing, especially car industry, jobs.\\nMidwest banks, reflecting the national picture, are also due for some\\nshrinkage because of over-capacity.\\n'We're coming back from a very weak position.

       " 'FT911-129': \"FOR all the hype over the past 20 years about how robots would transform\\nmanufacturing industry, they still remain on the fringes of the industrial\\nscene - with the notable exception of manufacturing in Japan.\\nAccording to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the world\\nindustrial robot population stood at 388,000 units at the end of 1989, of\\nwhich 220,000 were in Japan, 56,000 in western Europe, 37,000 in the US and\\n -very roughly - 75,000 elsewhere.\\nThere are a number of interconnected reasons for this situation. In the\\npast, there has been considerable hostility from trade unions to their\\nintroduction and managements have taken a lot of convincing about the cost\\nbenefits.\\nDr Kevin Clarke, manager of manufacturing engineering at PA Consulting\\nGroup, says that, in many instances, robots have not delivered the cost\\neffectiveness they have promised. Robot manufacturers, he says, have not\\ndeveloped their products technologically as fast as they might have.\\n'There's very little innovation, because the market isn't there,' he says.\\nHowever, the evidence of the past two years suggests that things may be\\nchanging. Those 388,000 units represented an increase of 20 per cent from\\nthe end of 1988, and in 1990 US-based robotics companies won record new\\norders of Dollars 517.4m.\\nThe robotics industry was in deep gloom during 1986 and 1987, and especially\\nin the US where it had become far too dependent on the motor industry -\\nwhich took about 40 to 50 per cent of sales.\\nMr Donald Vincent, executive vice-president of the US Robotic Industries\\nAssociation, recalls that 'when the automotive industry quit buying in 1986\\nand 1987, it sent robotics into a deep spin.'\\nThis decline had two results. First, it encouraged a much-needed\\nconcentration among robot producers. In the middle of the 1980s there were\\nsome 300, according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). Now,\\nit says, there are probably fewer than 100 true producers, led by ABB\\nRobotics, part of the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri, GMF Robotics, a joint\\nventure between Fanuc of Japan and General Motors of the US, and Yaskawa of\\nJapan.\\nSecondly, the downturn prompted an urgent search for new applications for\\nrobots away from the motor industry and its inherent cyclicality. Dr Clarke\\nsingles out 'clean room' applications for robots in health care and\\nprecision engineering, while Mr Vincent is hopeful of new applications in\\nthe food industry, materials handling and packaging.\\nThe wellspring for this diversification into new markets, which has already\\nbegun, is computer power. In mechanical terms, robots are relatively simple\\nbeasts, and robotic technology has always been based on the use of computers\\nto overcome mechanical limitations.\\nMr Kenneth Waldron, a robotics expert at Ohio State University, says 'the\\nmajor theme which will direct commercial applications of new research in\\nrobotics will be that of taking advantage of the huge increases in computing\\npower which have become available as a result of the development of advanced\\nmicroprocessors.'\\nMr Waldron notes that most current industrial robot systems offer only\\nincremental improvements over what was possible with the first generation of\\nmicrocomputer controllers.\\nCurrent research is looking at areas such as greater use of sensing - of the\\nrobot's environment and internal state - more sophisticated control\\ntechniques offering greater speed and accuracy, robotic mobility and\\nimproved control of the interface between the robot and the workpiece.\\nGiven these trends, there has inevitably been considerable interest in\\nindustrial vision systems for robots, which could radically change many\\napplications, particularly in assembly where robots have so far failed to\\nmake their mark.\\nPrevious forecasts for the population of vision-equipped robots have not\\nbeen realised, but it is reasonable to predict, as the IFR has, that the\\ncontinuous reduction in prices of computers and sensors, and their greater\\nspeed and reliability, will gradually remove the technological and economic\\nbarriers.\\nMany of the business trends in robotics over the past few years are\\nillustrated by developments at ABB Robotics, which claims to be the world's\\nbiggest supplier - a title which the Japanese manufacturers might dispute.\\nABB's purchase last year of Cincinnati Milacron's robotics business was an\\nimportant step in the consolidation of the industry around leading European\\nand Japanese suppliers. Mr Stelio Demark, head of ABB Robotics, says the\\nCincinnati business brought with it a tremendous US customer base and\\nundoubted expertise in spot-welding robotics.\\nThe nature of ABB's customer base has also been changing, and over the past\\nfive years it has reduced its dependence on the automotive industry from\\n70-75 per cent of sales to 50 per cent. ABB is attracting new business from\\nsmall and medium-sized companies which had previously not bought robots. 'We\\nmay be supplying ones and twos, but it's growing very quickly,' says Mr\\nDemark.\\nNew markets include glass making, different kinds of process applications,\\nand palletising. This effort is backed up by spending on research and\\ndevelopment - 10 per cent of revenues - that is almost on a par with that of\\nthe pharmaceutical industry.\\nMeanwhile the falling cost of electronics is allowing ABB to build more\\ncapability and flexibility into its robots. ABB's latest product, the IRB\\n6000, was officially launched last month with claims of much greater\\nflexibility and capability than rival products.\\nBecause of these developments, Mr Demark is optimistic about future growth\\nprospects for ABB and the industry. The view is shared by independent\\nobservers.\\nIn a report about to be published by Frost & Sullivan, the international\\nmarket research publishers, total world robot sales are forecast to rise\\nfrom Dollars 2.15bn in 1990 to Dollars 3.41bn in 1996. The relatively small\\nsize of the industry at the end of the 1980s is a reflection of many of the\\nfactors mentioned above.\\nF & S sees the Japanese market's share of world robot sales falling from 65\\nper cent last year to 45 per cent in 1996, while Europe's share will rise\\nfrom 15 to 20 per cent, the US will mark time at about 6 per cent and the\\nrest of the world will jump from 14 per cent to just under 30 per cent.\\nThe biggest growth area is Asia, which is good news for the Japanese\\nproducers, but Europe, says Mr Demark, is also 'very interesting,' and the\\ncompany's home base. F & S sees the European market rising from Dollars 330m\\nin 1990 to Dollars 687m in 1996, with Germany leading the way.\\nLooking specifically at the European market, F & S comments that the\\n'supplier capable of marketing a complete package including sensors,\\nuser-friendly software and simple training and installation will achieve the\\nbest sales penetration.'\\nABB is probably justified in claiming that it offers more service and\\nsupport to European buyers than the more product-based approach of the\\nJapanese, but Dr Clarke wonders whether this will still be true in two\\nyears' time. On the other hand Europe, he says, is probably not one of the\\nJapanese producers' priorities, given the better growth prospects in the\\nAsia Pacific region.\\nAs for the balance of power in the industry, both ABB and the Japanese are\\ngrowing stronger, the big producers are getting bigger, and the smaller\\nrobotics companies, particularly in the US and UK, are concentrating on\\nniches and ancillary services.\\nIf the big producers can keep up with development in computing, the 1990s\\ncould well bring the rewards that proved so elusive for much fo the 1980s.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-130': \"THE time taken to design and manufacture a new product could be reduced\\nsubstantially if both operations were carried out together, instead of one\\nafter the other as was the almost unavoidable practice in traditional\\nengineering before the widespread use of computer power.\\nWorking out how to make a product in a mass production process at the same\\ntime as the product is designed is the essence of simultaneous, concurrent\\nor integrated engineering, the various descriptions given to an emerging\\napproach to engineering where everything is done at once.\\nThis may seem impossible. Yet computers have made it possible for work to\\nproceed on the design of a product at the same time as on the ways of making\\nthe product.\\nWith simultaneous engineering, the design of a new product takes account of\\nhow it will be made, so that the easiest, most economic way to make the\\nproduct is chosen and is feasible.\\nTraditionally, if a design made it difficult for a company to manufacture\\nand mass produce the product as designed, then the design was modified until\\nthe manufacturing difficulty was overcome.\\nThe essence of simultaneous, or concurrent engineering is that account is\\ntaken of the manufacturing process as the design proceeds, so avoiding\\nredesign at a late stage in the development of a product and its\\nmanufacturing process.\\nAn illustration of the importance of simultaneous engineering is the way new\\nproducts are designed using new materials, such as the advanced ceramic\\nmaterials that are being developed for jet engines.\\nThese materials have distinct advantages over the metals traditionally used\\nfor these applications, but in order for manufacturers to exploit these\\nadvantages to the utmost, they have to take account of how these materials\\nwill behave when they are used in production processes.\\nIn other words, the production process has to be developed hand in hand with\\nthe design of the product.\\nThe only way to do this is through simultaneous engineering.\\nMr James Angus, the team leader at the Rolls-Royce Advanced Ceramics Centre\\nat Warwick University, where integrated engineering techniques are being\\ndeveloped for future jet engine components, says the integration of design\\nengineering, materials science and manufacturing technology is essential for\\nthe new ceramic materials because, for the first time with any material, the\\ndesigner has the opportunity to design the material to suit exactly the\\nproperties needed in a component.\\nThis unusual way of designing a product or component has to take account of\\nthe way the product will be manufactured and mass produced and vice versa,\\notherwise the carefully tailored material properties of the component could\\nbe lost.\\nMs Sue Lyons, the director of manufacturing engineering at Rolls-Royce, says\\n'we are moving towards completely integrated or concurrent engineering\\nacross the company.'\\nThe integrated programme is being finalised and all technology groups, such\\nas stress and mechanical engineers and manufacturing specialists will come\\ntogether at the conceptual design stage of a new product.\\nMs Lyons says 'the division between design and manufacturing could disappear\\naltogether.'\\nThe change to integrated engineering is crucial because of the high\\nproportion of a product's cost that is set at the design stage.\\nIn the case of a jet engine as much as 80 per cent of the cost of a new\\nproduct for the engine is fixed at the design stage. The aim is to reduce\\nthis fixed cost element in a product by designing it so that it is easy to\\nmanufacture.\\nIt is possible to influence significantly the final cost of a product,\\nincluding its manufacturing cost, by the addition of only very little extra\\ncost at the design stage.\\nMr Robin Blake, of Rolls-Royce says that 'concurrent engineering is not an\\nalternative for consideration, it is an absolute necessity. The demands to\\nreduce lead time and cost can only be met by teamwork in a concurrent\\nengineering environment.'\\nComputer systems available to handle concurrent engineering include systems\\nfrom Intergraph, one of the world's largest companies developing and\\nmanufacturing interactive computer graphics for computer aided engineering.\\nIntergraph won an order last year, potentially worth Dollars 40m, from the\\nUS Sandia National Laboratories for systems with a concurrent engineering\\ncapability. The agreement called on Intergraph to supply hardware and\\nsoftware for the Nirvana project, the code name for the Sandia National\\nLaboratories/US Department of Energy programme to implement a computer aided\\ndesign and manufacturing system with a concurrent engineering capability.\\nNirvana was designed to help Sandia, which is the US Department of Energy\\nprime contractor for nuclear research, and its sub-contractors to move from\\nusing multi-vendor, non-integrated solutions to particular problems to a\\nmore efficient integrated approach.\\nIn the first year of the agreement, Intergraph will supply a range of\\nengineering design software tools and about 140 of its Risc-based UNIX\\nworkstations. The hardware and software will be used to integrate and\\nimprove the design, manufacture and assembly of complex electronics-based\\nproducts.\\nThese tools will operate under a common user framework. Product design\\ninformation will flow from initial system design, through sub-system design,\\nthe design of printed circuit boards, hybrid and integrated circuit design\\nthrough mechanical design and on to manufacturing, including document\\npublishing.\\nAdditional data is to be added to the design definition at each step and\\ndesign data from preceding steps will not need to be re-entered.\\nMr Dick Fox, the UK marketing director of Intergraph says the result will be\\nhigh quality products designed and manufactured in a shorter period of time\\nthan would otherwise be possible, one of the objects of concurrent\\nengineering.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-131': \"ALMOST every type of computer hardware that exists in a commercial data\\nprocessing department can be found somewhere in a manufacturing environment.\\nThe basic electronics of manufacturing technology is the same as in the rest\\nof the business world; it is the fine-tuning which is different.\\nLarge manufacturers typically depend on a mainframe for their central\\ncorporate functions and this is likely to continue.\\nThough most want to make more information available to users by introducing\\ndistributed systems and client/server architectures, the need for the\\nbiggest companies to consolidate and store large volumes of data will\\nprobably persist. Only a mainframe can cope with that load.\\nMoreover, the spread of ED1 (electronic data interchange, or paperless\\ntrading) could slow or even reverse the erosion of the role of the\\nmainframe.\\nHowever, as mainframes are no longer cheaper to run than smaller boxes,\\nmanufacturing applications such as MRP systems have been steadily moving,\\nthrough a process of downsizing, from mainframes to mid-range machines or\\neven networks of personal computers.\\nThe general change of management strategy in manufacturing, from central\\ncontrol to local responsibility - the so-called cellular concept - favours\\nthe spread of mid-range machines or PCs rather than mainframes.\\nIn the past decade computing has brought great changes to the management of\\nmanufacturing through MRP systems, but it has only just begun to make an\\nimpact on the shop-floor.\\nMost shop-floors receive an action list as output from the MRP system and\\nthat is as far as the computer stretches. The advent of the just-in-time\\nmanufacturing philosophy has persuaded many companies that the computer has\\nto be introduced on the shop-floor to support the production process.\\nShop-floor data collection is usually handled by a mid-range machine,\\nalthough PCs are replacing mid-range machines in some sites.\\nMid-range open systems hardware based on the UNIX operating system is\\nbeginning to be used in factories where the ability to integrate systems\\nfrom different manufacturers is essential.\\nPersonal computers have changed the life of factories, if rather slower than\\nthat of offices.\\nAs factories get cleaner, standard PCs can be used in more and more places.\\nIt is now often quite appropriate for an ordinary PC to be in a foreman's\\noffice.\\nTens of thousands of PCs, mainly IBM or clones, are scattered around British\\nfactories. On the design side, workstations from companies such as Sun\\nMicrosystems and Hewlett-Packard are the standard tools of the trade.\\nWhere life is too rough for the standard PC, ruggedised machines are used.\\nIn some cases robust terminals can be put on the shop-floor with the main\\ncomputing facility kept in a back office or, for that matter, in another\\ntown or country. Local computing power is usually needed for many\\napplications that involve graphics or diagrams. For these the machine has to\\nbe on site because the telecommunications system cannot transmit high\\nvolumes of data over any great distance.\\nSpecially adapted equipment or protective packaging may be needed in the\\nfactory for many reasons, as Mr Graham Crocker, a manufacturing specialist\\nat IBM, points out. It may be dirty, the temperature may vary from very hot\\nto very cold, there may be vibration or disruption of the electricity\\nsupply.\\nThere may be risk of fire or liquid being spilled or worker's hands may be\\ngreasy. There may be electromagnetic interference from other machines,\\nrequiring computers to be kept in steel cases.\\nShop-floor workers may be less familiar with computer systems than office\\nworkers; special keyboards with function keys may be preferable to the\\nconventional Qwerty layout.\\nOn the shop-floor small ruggedised hand-held computers from companies such\\nas Coventry-based Husky are being adopted by some large companies both for\\ndata collection and for quality control.\\nAt the Royal Doulton china factories, for example, Huskys are used to keep\\ntrack of the 40,000 types of product.\\nHand-held and laptop machines have grown in popularity as they have got\\nlighter and their screens have become easier to read. At the same time they\\nhave been enhanced by being able to store more data and to run longer before\\nthe battery needs changing.\\nThe principal requirement of the manufacturer which differs from that of the\\ncommercial user is a high degree of hardware availability.\\nReliability is one aspect of availability. Mr Richard Ridler, manufacturing\\nindustry marketing manager for ICL, points out that whereas some office\\nsystems can go down for 10 or 20 minutes occasionally without causing\\nanything worse than annoyance, in a factory this could be disastrous.\\nMr Graham McKenzie, manufacturing systems manager with Digital, identifies\\nthree levels of resilience.\\nDigital VAXes can be clustered so that if a disk drive fails on one recovery\\ncan be achieved within a few minutes. Two machines can be connected within a\\nsingle cabinet so that if one goes down the other will pick up the task\\nwithin a few seconds. Or three machines can be tightly coupled so that if\\none of them fails the process will carry on uninterrupted and unnoticed by\\nthe user; this is normally called fault-tolerance.\\nResponse time is another aspect of availability. Industrial users expect\\nsubsecond response times for many functions, where office users could be\\nasked to be more patient.\\nA third factor is the working regime. Office systems are typically shut down\\nto users overnight and at weekends, whereas factory systems may have to work\\na 24-hour day and about 360 days a year. It is therefore important for the\\nmanufacturer to decide what level of availability is needed for his systems\\nbefore investing in hardware. Continuous uptime can be achieved, but the\\nprice goes up as availability is increased.\\nProspects for systems suppliers to manufacturers in the longer term must be\\nrated as good.\\nThe negative signs are that, as in the office market, users are expecting to\\npay less for more all the time and the market for MRP systems shows some\\nsigns of saturation. Only the smaller factories do not have these systems\\nand they may either have no pressing need or no money to invest.\\nOn the positive side the pressure of competition is making manufacturers\\nconcentrate more on the need for automation, especially on the shop-floor.\\nLarge manufacturers are getting stricter with their suppliers on quality,\\nforcing those companies to invest more in technology. Finally, the\\ntechnology itself is clearly becoming ever more capable of delivering real\\nbenefits.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-132': \"SOFTWARE to control manufacturing is among the most complex of commercial\\napplications. In its most sophisticated form it entails connections between\\ncustomers, suppliers, accounting, warehousing and the shop-floor. Its\\nimplementation must therefore be carefully co-ordinated.\\nIn the 1960s, IBM, among others, recognising that manufactured products\\ncould be progressively 'exploded' into a bill of materials, realised how\\nuseful a computer could be in estimating the raw material quantities\\nrequired to make up finished goods. These databases, originally held on\\npunched cards, evolved rapidly. The data handling needs of Bill of Materials\\nProcessing (Bomp), led software designers to create hierarchical databases,\\nfrom which products such as IBM's IMS\\nEarly systems provided data for Materials Requirements Planning (MRP).\\nTake a manufactured item, reduce it into sub assemblies, then explode those\\nprogressively until you have raw materials, multiply the numbers by the\\noverall quantity of finished goods needed, and you have an estimate of\\noverall requirements.\\nAlly that to a manufacturing schedule - showing which parts are needed when\\n -and you have a planning system from which you can order goods.\\nSuch systems were very useful for manufacturing goods made up of discrete\\nparts. However, for process applications - production of paint, foods or\\nother products - the process is not so simple. The number of a certain type\\nof switch or body panel needed to make a car does not vary. You may have\\nsome wastage in small items such as nuts and bolts, but the quantities used\\nare still discrete. In continuous process manufacturing you must rely more\\non statistics than precise figures. You are not producing one product at a\\ntime, but a continuous stream of the product. The principles may seem\\nsimilar, but the practice is more complex.\\nA consideration common to both discrete and continuous process manufacturing\\ncan be batch control. You may need to track a batch of finished goods from\\nits components, through to its eventual customers.\\nWhen a batch of yoghurt was found to contain botulism the manufacturers had\\nto be able to say precisely where the tainted goods had gone, and then go\\nback and identify the raw material responsible to find out which other goods\\nmight be similarly affected. As a result, they were able to focus their\\nwarnings on a particular set of hazelnut flavour products. Inability to\\ntrack products in this way would lead to the wholesale withdrawal of a\\nproduct line, with disastrous consequences for the manufacturer's profits.\\nThe production planning process involves ensuring that enough goods are\\nproduced to meet forward orders for a period, without running out or\\nbecoming overstocked. The effect of this flows back to the beginning of the\\nprocess. You must take delivery of enough raw materials to ensure that your\\nproduction lines do not stop for the want of a component, but that your\\nparts inventory does not overwhelm your storage and financial resources.\\nMoreover, your suppliers must be able to schedule their production processes\\nto ensure that you are supplied with goods at the right time and in the\\nright quantity.\\nThe first MRP systems did not cater for this requirement. They were able to\\nextrapolate need based on orders and schedules. Purchasing managers had to\\nensure that the correct quantities were ordered at the correct time.\\nWith MRP II systems, the interface between the outside world - suppliers and\\ncustomers - and the manufacturing system is automated. The system is driven\\nby sales order processing. Customers' future ordering requirements are\\nentered into the system. These are exploded into component parts, and a\\nschedule of raw materials is built up. At this time the system may be\\ndealing with estimates in the form of future ordering requirements from\\ncomponent suppliers. From these will be generated similar forecasts all the\\nway back to the suppliers of the basic raw products.\\nOnce the sales order becomes firm, the manufacturer can call off goods from\\nhis suppliers, based on the schedule - with whatever variations might be\\nneeded to suit actual needs.\\nIf the MRP system is sufficiently advanced, all this can be automated. Sales\\norders, once input, can automatically drive the whole process. Using\\nelectronic document interchange (EDI) no further human intervention should\\nbe needed after the input of a customer order. All intermediate\\ndocumentation right down the chain of suppliers can be automatically\\nproduced.\\nThe need for standards for data interchange is obvious, and there are a\\nnumber in use. In the motor industry there is Odette, other standards\\ninclude ANSI X12 and Edufact. These define the form and contents of\\ndocuments and electronic packages.\\nSome suppliers of manufacturing software, such as Istel, a subsidiary of A T\\n& T, point to the importance of the open systems movement. However,\\naccording to Mr Alan Topliss, of Price Waterhouse, their robustness,\\nsecurity and ability to handle the very large amounts of data needed, are\\nstill not considered sufficient by many users.\\nThe most advanced use of MRP, mainly for companies producing in relatively\\nlow numbers is Just In Time (Jit) manufacturing. The idea is to produce\\ngoods only when they are needed - rather than stockpiling them. The\\nramifications flow right back down the chain. You must be able to call off\\nordered parts from your suppliers in the same fashion. A motor manufacturer,\\nfor example, may only keep a small stock of wheels - perhaps two hours'\\nsupply. In these circumstances, you need not only to forecast your numbers,\\nbut also how long it will take to deliver them.\\nIt is logical to drive shop floor control systems from MRP. However, as Mr\\nTony Baggot of EDS points out, you need a competent 'systems integrator' who\\nunderstands how to link together all the disparate components. 'It's not\\njust a matter of connecting machines up, they must share the same protocols'\\nhe stresses.\\nThe automation of manufacturing is an area in which not only machines, but\\nalso the operations of companies become interlinked. The benefits are\\nobvious, but the complexity calls for careful adherence to standards.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-133': \"BILL Hillier joined the Science and Engineering Research Council (Serc) six\\nyears ago 'to see if I could help to get academia to work with industry'. He\\nmoved from industry, Racal Redac, where he worked on computer-aided design,\\nto become the co-ordinator of the Acme research programme at the Serc's\\nheadquarters in Swindon.\\nAcme stands for Applications of Computers in Manufacturing. Serc invests\\nabout Pounds 7m a year through Acme in projects in universities and\\npolytechnics in Britain. These projects cover the whole range of computing\\nin manufacturing, from work on the control of robots, for example, through\\ncomputer-aided design to production management.\\nMr Hillier says 'Acme activities emphasise research at universities into\\nreal problems that are industrially relevant.' The R & D is not, though,\\nday-to-day trouble shooting. Industry does not expect academia researchers\\nto provide immediate answers to short-term problems. Mr Hillier says that\\nAcme hopes to support research that will deliver useful results within two\\nto five years.\\nIn all, Acme supports something like 135 projects. These range from small\\ngrants for visiting fellowship to large clubs with industry. The largest\\ngrants are for about Pounds 350,000 for three years.\\nSerc launched the Acme programme six years ago. Since then it has awarded\\ngrants worth a total that is approaching Pounds 40m. The work, on about 400\\nprojects, is in four main areas; advanced production machines,\\ncomputer-aided engineering, manufacturing processes, and planning and\\nmanagement.\\nIn each Acme project, the Serc expects academic institutions to work closely\\nwith industrial partners. Industry may contribute financially to a project -\\nit adds an average 15 per cent to the Serc's contribution - but in many\\ncases, industry's contribution is not so much financial as in time and other\\nresources. For example, companies sometimes provide materials for processing\\nin university projects.\\nAcme's projects cover a wide range of industries. For example, the Control\\nand Robotics Group, part of the Department of Electronic Engineering at the\\nuniversity of Hull, is involved in several projects with the shoe and\\ngarment industries. The aim of this research is to develop automated\\nmanufacturing processes.\\nIn one research project at Hull, the group is developing a robotic work cell\\nto assemble complete garments, in this case underpants. Each cell would have\\nseven or eight machines performing a particular task on a garment before\\npassing it on to the next stage.\\nIn the cell, robot vision system would recognise the parts and tell the\\nmachines what to do with them. A big problem with textiles is that the parts\\nare flexible. This makes it difficult for an optical system to recognise the\\nshape. 'Pick up a dishcloth and it doesn't look like a rectangle at all,'\\nsays Dr Gaynor Taylor, a researcher in the group.\\nThe industrial collaborator is Corah, a garment manufacturer that supplies\\nMarks and Spencer. The ultimate aim of this work is to develop a production\\ncell that can receive cut parts at one end and deliver finished garments\\nfrom the other. In their research, the Hull group analyses the production\\nprocess a step at a time.\\nAnother series of projects brings together researchers from the universities\\nof Durham and Hull. Their industrial collaborator is British United Shoe\\nMachinery (BUSM).\\nHere the step-by-step approach is even more important because companies\\nmaking shoes are not accustomed to investing large amounts in machinery. So\\nthe projects set out to automate individual steps of shoe production, with a\\nparticular emphasis on preparing the parts and sewing them together before\\nthey go on the final manufacturing stages.\\nThe aim of the project is not to develop prototype machines, says Mr Taylor.\\nIt is up to the machinery makers to develop commercial equipment.\\nThe research at Durham and Hull has concentrated on the use of electronic\\nvision and image recognition equipment and other technologies to develop\\nmanufacturing and handling processes that do not have to be altered every\\ntime a company changes the style of the shoes that it is making.\\nMr David Reedman is on the receiving end of this research. He is manager of\\nresearch for BUSM. 'Universities and polytechnics are very good at research\\nbut not at product development,' he says.\\nMr Reedman believes that projects with academic researchers can tell a\\nmanufacturer if a particular piece of technology will work in its industry.\\n'I ask 'Can I use this technology in Shoe making?'' he says. 'A research\\nproject which establishes quickly and efficiently that a new technology is\\nunsuitable is just as successful, if not as acceptable, as one with a more\\npositive outcome.'\\n'What you get out of the university research is usually a model that\\ndemonstrates some principle,' says Mr Reedman. It is then down to\\ndevelopment engineers to turn the idea into commercial products. Earlier\\nthis month at a trade show in Germany, BUSM showed a prototype shoe\\nstitching machine based on its work with the university research teams.\\nOver the past five years, BUSM has benefited from grants totalling almost\\nPounds 450,000 for work at the two universities. 'I don't see how we can\\nsurvive without the research,' says Mr Reedman.\\nAcme supports a range of projects in the general area of computer aided\\ndesign. Dr Bob Cripps at the university of Birmingham, works on the computer\\nmodelling of surfaces and how they behave in various manufacturing\\nprocesses. One such project involved collaboration with Austin Rover on a\\nphenomenon know as springback.\\nWhen a piece of flat steel is pressed into a complex shape, a car bonnet for\\nexample, it takes up the exact shape of the press. But remove the pressure\\nand the shape changes slightly. In the past, getting the right shape was\\nmore a black art than a science, according to Dr Bob Cripps who worked on\\nthe project.\\nThe Birmingham team computerised the whole process of design manufacture of\\ncomplex components in an attempt to understand the phenomenon of springback.\\nThe idea was to be able to predict exactly how much of a change in shape a\\ncomponent would experience as it came out of a press.\\nThe work at Birmingham achieved its goal, the researchers could predict the\\namount of springback that would occur. However, in the process of\\ncomputerising the manufacturing process, the problem of springback lessened.\\nAnother task facing manufacturers is to move products around in factories.\\nIn another Acme project, Professor Mike Brady of Oxford University has\\ndeveloped an automatic sensing system that can guide an unmanned vehicle\\naround a factory.\\nThis Pounds 250,000 project, with four industrial collaborators including\\nGEC and Thorn-EMI, has resulted in the development of a vehicle equipped\\nwith a laser-rangefinder and ultrasonic position detection. Sensors feed\\ninformation into an on-board computer that can then pick a route around\\nunexpected obstacles.\\nComputerised hardware is an essential part of any manufacturing system.\\nThere are, however, other issues facing the manufacturer who wants to\\nintroduce new technology. This too is an area for academic research. Mr Mike\\nGregory is pioneering a new area of research - for academia at least.\\nThere is nothing new about research on the technology of manufacturing,\\nengineering departments have been doing it since their beginnings.\\nResearchers have also studied the social impacts of new manufacturing\\ntechnology on the workplace, but they have yet to look seriously at the\\nmanagement of manufacturing.\\nMr Gregory believes that before a company can develop a manufacturing\\nstrategy, it needs to undertake a manufacturing audit. Companies need to\\ndesign manufacturing systems that meet their business requirements. To\\nachieve this, he says, 'We need more research into the interface between\\norganisations and technology'.\\nMore research is only of value if the results reach industry. Mr Gregory's\\nwork has led to a booklet called Competitive Manufacturing, that is\\npublished by the Department of Trade and Industry. There are, though, gaps\\nin the flow of information from R & D on computers in manufacturing.\\nThe government's Advisory Council on Science and Technology (Acost)\\nhighlighted these gaps in its recent report called Advanced Manufacturing\\nTechnology. The report drew attention to the lack of co-ordination in the\\nvarious activities in advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). 'The\\naggregation of the dispersed knowledge of AMT in the UK, both industrial and\\nacademic, together with the acquisition of international experience, can\\noffer individual companies a valuable new resource,' says the report.\\nProfessor Lionel Maunder of the university of Newcastle, chairman of Acost's\\nEngineering Technologies Committee, hopes that this report will lead to the\\ncreation of local centres where industry can seek information on advanced\\nmanufacturing technologies. It has prompted the DTI to enter into discussion\\nwith the Science and Engineering Research Council on the issue.\\nUnfortunately, the Acme programme has been hit by the shortage of funds\\nfacing the Serc. The programme has to find savings of some 15 per cent. This\\nwill inevitably put pressure on the DTI's own R & D programmes.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-134': \"MANUFACTURING companies have identified EDI (electronic data interchange, or\\npaperless trading) as potentially one of their most effective weapons in the\\nbattle for survival.\\nHundreds of British manufacturing companies are beginning to feel the\\nbenefits of cutting out bureaucracy and dealing via computer to place\\norders, send invoices and make payments.\\nSome British manufacturers believe that they could derive significant\\nadvantages from EDI when the single European market is fully operational.\\nThe UK is well advanced in EDI compared to other European countries because\\nof the development of standards by the Article Number Association and the\\nSimpler Trading Procedures Board and because of value-added network services\\ncreated in the wake of telecommunications deregulation.\\nThe ANA developed Tradacoms, the UK standard for trading communications, in\\n1982. This gave birth to services such as Tradanet offered by International\\nNetwork Services (INS), the EDI supplier co-owned by ICL and General\\nElectric Information Services of the US. About 1,500 UK manufacturers do\\nbusiness via Tradanet.\\nAs companies search for ways of improving their business operations, they\\nhave realised that many changes will be dependent on direct\\ncomputer-to-computer links with their suppliers and customers.\\nIn particular, Jit (just in time manufacturing, a manufacturing philosophy\\nwhich has spread from Japan across the world in the past 10 years) can only\\nwork properly on an EDI infrastructure.\\nThis represents a considerable change of attitude from the early days of\\nEDI, when it was seen simply as a cost-cutting technique. Now the emphasis\\nhas moved from saving money to providing a better service to customers\\nthrough swifter response to demand and more competitive prices.\\nSupply chain management is the centre of attention. Members of the supply\\nchain comprise what has been called a virtual organisation.\\nThis involves a new way of thinking about the whole production process.\\nFor example, in a virtual organisation it is possible to cut out duplication\\nof quality assurance.\\nComponents which have been rigorously tested by the maker to his customer's\\nstandards are not re-tested on arrival at the customer but go directly into\\nstock or, better still, straight into production.\\nWhen component makers receive their orders and confirm delivery\\nelectronically, production scheduling can be more tightly controlled. The\\nresult can be shrinking lead times and stock is sharply reduced or\\neliminated.\\nNot surprisingly, the vanguard of EDI users is to be found in sectors which\\nare technologically-oriented. The electronics business began the switch in\\n1987.\\nLeaders in that field, such as ICL, have progressed in the last three years\\nto using EDI on an international scale to deal with component suppliers in\\nthe US and continental Europe.\\nNCR uses EDI to exchange forecast demands regularly with its trading\\npartners in a Jit environment. Texas Instruments makes a point of its EDI\\ncapability in its marketing slogan which insists it is 'better to do\\nbusiness with'.\\nTelecommunications manufacturers are becoming keen EDI adherents. Mitel, the\\nCanadian private branch exchange (PBX) maker which is 51 per cent owned by\\nBritish Telecom, is in the process of converting.\\nIt expects to have over 30 of its suppliers communicating via computer by\\nthe end of the year for purchase orders. This will be followed by accepting\\ninvoices from suppliers electronically and then by paying them through the\\nBACS banking network.\\nMr Jeremy Arnold, Mitel's EDI co-ordinator says that although cost-saving is\\nimportant the main aim is to establish better long-term partnerships and cut\\nlead times in production.\\nThe automotive sector is another which is taking up EDI rapidly, led by\\nleading manufacturers including Rover, Peugeot-Talbot, Citroen and Renault.\\nThis sector, like others, has its own EDI user support group, called Odette,\\nwhich is active in eight European countries and is run in the UK by the\\nSociety of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.\\nAccording to Ms Kerry Shipley, its project manager, there are over 400 EDI\\nuser companies in the automotive business in the UK.\\nThis represents a high proportion of the leading companies but she notes\\nthat their use of EDI is still restricted to a few functions such as\\ninvoicing and delivery instructions.\\nShe expects to see a steady expansion in the number of types of message sent\\nbetween members in the next five years.\\nAt the same time there may be a second wave of recruits to Odette as many\\nsmaller companies will be compelled by their larger customers to take up\\nEDI.\\nThe big companies are not officially making EDI mandatory for their trading\\npartners, but they are stressing that an EDI capability is one of the\\ncriteria for becoming a preferred supplier.\\nOther EDI user groups serving specific sectors include Cefic for chemical\\ncompanies and Edifice for electronics companies.\\nAerospace is another area in which large manufacturers are driving EDI down\\nto small suppliers.\\nBritish Aerospace, for example, keen to adopt a Jit approach, has begun\\nusing EDI not just with its production partners but with suppliers of other\\ngoods and services too.\\nThe laggard in EDI is still government.\\nManufacturers which supply ministries and local authorities are still\\ngenerally unable to communicate with them electronically.\\nHowever, even in this area there are signs of movement; the number of\\nsuppliers dealing electronically with the National Health Service has risen\\nto over 250.\\nMr Patrick Tonks, marketing manager for INS, says that large companies have\\nbeen putting a lot of effort into winning over their trading partners to the\\nEDI method.\\nRather than simply imposing a rule that all business with them must be done\\nelectronically in future, they are holding seminars to persuade them of the\\nbenefits of the new systems.\\nIn the long term there is little doubt that any large or medium-sized\\ncompany in manufacturing must go over to EDI.\\nHow long it will take is uncertain, but the trend is certainly accelerating;\\nand it is one of the bright spots of the computer industry which must give\\nit hope in its present time of crisis.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-135': \"IT seemed laughable at the time: a couple years ago a Japanese manufacturer\\nreplaced some factory line workers with automation machinery, then set up\\nfull-sized cardboard human dummies to keep the remaining workers from\\ngetting lonely.\\nThe completely workerless factory is a decade away, but there are a few\\nshowcase examples including Fanuc, the machine tool manufacturer's factory\\nnear Mount Fuji, where robots make robots. But until no-human factories are\\nrealised on a broad scale, factory automation system makers will focus their\\nresearch on bridging the awkward interaction between humans and the ever\\nincreasing number of machines working by their side.\\nIn past years manufacturers put the emphasis on installing labour-saving\\nmachines to raise production. They focused on maximising the use of people,\\nmoney, time and materials, and humans had to find a way to fit in with the\\ncomplex machinery beginning to surround them.\\n'Until now humans have had to adapt to use machines, so the man-machine\\ninterface was not well matched,' says Mr Hiroshi Matsuyama, a manager at\\nOmron the programmable controller maker in Tokyo.\\n'Japanese industry is now modifying its philosophy. The centre of production\\nhas shifted to human workers, and computers should be matched with humans,'\\nhe says. That means designing new software that allows production machinery\\nto be more easily used and changed quickly for different jobs. For example,\\nwelding or insertion and using artificial intelligence techniques such as\\nfuzzy logic to help robots and computers make better decisions, such as\\nfinding an operational failure, through inferences, as humans do.\\nThe escalating skilled labour shortage, brought about by a declining birth\\nrate and a more affluent and highly educated society, makes robots an\\nimportant component of factory automation, a do-or-die decision for some\\ncompanies.\\nStrong competition in industries such as shipping has resulted in waves of\\ninvestment in labour-saving technology such as steel and aluminium cutting\\ntools, processing machines and welding robots. The rise in the labour force\\nis expected to be 0.8 per cent a year until 1993, then it is likely to fall\\noff by half to 0.4 per cent until 2000, according to Japanese government\\nstatistics. During that time Japan expects to keep about a 4 per cent annual\\neconomic growth rate.\\n'To achieve this it is necessary to introduce automation technology,' says\\nMr Kanji Yonemoto, vice-chairman of the Japan Industrial Robot Association\\n(Jira) in Tokyo. An even more remarkable shift in Japan's economy is the\\nswitch from a manufacturing to a service economy.\\nJobs in services pay better. Mr Yonemoto says there will be 1.5m fewer\\nblue-collar workers in manufacturing by 2000 than in 1989, when there was a\\nshortage of 715,800 people. Today's young people are a different breed of\\nworker from those who laboured long hours for little pay to build Japan's\\nindustrial miracle.\\nThey want to avoid so-called '3K' work: 'kiken' (dangerous), 'kitanai'\\n(dirty) and 'kitsui' (hard). 'Older men were very patient and had the\\nBushido (warrior) morale, but it is hard to find these people today,' says\\nMr Matsuyama.\\nReplacing them with machinery takes time and money. Omron, which produces\\nprogrammable controllers and other electronics products, sees the\\nimprovements that can be made in factory automation as almost limitless and\\nincluding diagnosing system failures and other management tasks.\\nThe improvements span a broad factory automation market valued at almost\\nY2,000bn and covering every aspect of making a product from design through\\nproduction and inspection. The important components of automating a factory\\nare numerical controllers, the largest chunk of the market, as well as\\ncomputer-aided design and manufacturing software and equipment, industrial\\nrobots, programmable controllers, automated warehouses, computers and\\nautomatic guided vehicles that transport products throughout a plant site.\\nJapan leads the world in both producing and using these production\\ncomponents. It has replaced Germany as the biggest exporter of machine\\ntools, an important indicator of industrial development and economic power.\\nJapan has an estimated 23 per cent of the world market compared to the 16\\nper cent held by Germany.\\nFive Japanese companies are making machine tools in Europe. Mazak Yamazaki,\\nfor example, has a Dollars 50m factory in Worcester, in the UK which\\nproduces some 100 computer-controlled machines a month, according to\\nindustry estimates. Japan's worldwide share of the fast-growing robot market\\nis even more impressive: it has 57.5 per cent of the robot installations\\nworldwide, with western Europe having 14.5 per cent and the US 9.5 per cent.\\nJapan's main advantages are that workers in automotive, electronics and\\nother factories are accustomed to and readily accept automation technology,\\nproduct demand is still strong in the home market, and Japanese\\nmanufacturers make most of the machines they use for automation, so there is\\nlittle competition from imports.\\nThe electronics industry is the biggest user of automation technology. At\\nits Ome design and manufacturing works west of Tokyo, Toshiba uses its own\\nlaptop computers for design, development and assembly of new Toshiba\\nlaptops.\\nThe laptops are used to compute how easily a new computer model can be\\nassembled by a line of 12 workers, who can slap together one notebook-size\\nDynabook computer in a few minutes. That's important, because the company is\\nmaking about 1m laptops a year at Ome, and the life span of each new product\\nis getting increasingly shorter amid hot competition.\\n'Often it's the case with some products that the effective life span is\\nalready over by the time it goes to the market place,' says Mr Masao Suga,\\nwho heads the personal computer research and development department at Ome.\\nHowever, the shortening product life spans, which run from six months for a\\nJapanese word processor to about three years for laptops, made it\\nincreasingly difficult for Toshiba to continue using robots. Toshiba\\nreplicates about 70 per cent of design work from current models in new ones.\\nWhile it took Toshiba three years to develop the T3100 and J3100 laptops\\nfrom scratch, it took only nine months to design the smaller-size Dynabook.\\nThough its factory is about 70-80 per cent automated, visitors to the\\ncompany often comment about the number of people still present on the\\nmanufacturing lines, but Mr Suga says that with the fast-paced product life\\ncycles, humans are needed. 'There are problems with automated systems. They\\ncan't catch up with new technology, so humans are acting as universal super\\nrobots,' he adds.\\nFuzzy logic may help close the gap. Mr Yonemoto of Jira says fuzzy logic,\\nsoftware that can help make a decision from unclear information, will help\\nincrease the versatility of robots in the future by affording better control\\nof their movements. Omron, a leader in using fuzzy technology, has developed\\na test robot that can grasp soft or fragile items, such as tofu (bean curd).\\nIn a New Year's address to employees, Mr Yoshio Tateisi, company president,\\nidentified fuzzy logic as an important research area for the 1990s. By 1994,\\nmore than 20 per cent of Omron's product line will include some type of\\nfuzzy logic. According to Mr Matsuyama, fuzzy logic has many benefits. As\\npart of a computer-integrated manufacturing (Cim) system it can be used in\\nproduction and in managing the company.\\n'Another merit of fuzzy technology is to replace a person where computers\\nare hard to use, for example, controlling a nuclear power generation plant's\\ncirculation control system to clean water and to make decisions. Perhaps the\\nChernobyl or Mihama plant accidents could have been avoided with these\\nsystems,' he says.\\nFuzzy logic, along with more flexible robots and other components, spell\\nanother technological advantage for Japan in the future: being able to\\nchange small-scale production quickly, so that multiple products can be\\nproduced on the same factory line in one day. Mr Matsuyama predicts Japanese\\nmanufacturers will become very good at this small-scale production, which is\\na difficult technology demanding ultimate flexibility.\\nComputerisation would be all the more necessary in production in the sense\\nthat market information should be more effectively connected with the\\nproduction process or with the factory itself. But large-scale flexible\\nproduction without man will take 8-10 years says Matsushita Electric in\\nOsaka.\\nThe company believes fuzzy logic, along with neurocomputing technology which\\nmore closely mimics the human brain, will be the main technologies once they\\nare refined.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-136': \"AT the end of last month Case Communications, the Dowty subsidiary that\\nmakes modems, multiplexors and other data communications products, called\\ntogether 80 of its leading suppliers.\\nIt was less than happy about the quality of some of the components it was\\nreceiving and their late arrival. Having spent three years radically and\\nsometimes painfully overhauling its own manufacturing facilities, Case would\\nnow like its suppliers to do the same.\\nThe company has not issued an ultimatum. With a turnover of just under\\nPounds 100m a year it is not big enough to insist on improvements from its\\nsuppliers. Nor would Case's ingrained corporate culture of co-operation and\\nteam-working allow it to contemplate such a move.\\nThe fact remains, however, that Case will reduce the number of suppliers it\\nuses in the coming years.\\nThe company is no longer willing to spend money testing goods it has\\npurchased to make sure they perform to specification. Similarly, it does not\\nwant to have to stock large amounts of goods because only 60 per cent are\\ndelivered on time.\\nMr Alex Kachellek, the company's manufacturing director, says that Case\\ndelivers 95 per cent of its products on time. Three years ago the figure was\\n55 per cent. Four years ago the company's performance was not measured. It\\nwas sufficient to know that monthly revenue targets were being met and that\\nthe company was making a profit.\\nUnder these comfortable conditions, the sweeping changes that Mr Kachellek\\nproposed in 1988 were met with many raised eyebrows.\\nEven the six-person team he set up to implement the changes had at least one\\ndissenter at the outset. Apart from improving delivery, Mr Kachellek wanted\\nto make-to-order (rather than to forecast) and in the shortest time\\npossible. The first step, he declared, would be to reduce lead times from\\nsix weeks or more to 15 days.\\nAs a youngish electronics manufacturer, Case had a solid foundation for the\\nstructural changes Mr Kachellek sought. The company understood computers and\\ncommunication products. They were its business.\\nAll 1,200 people employed at its Watford headquarters could use and had\\naccess to computer terminals. The terminals were networked so that\\ninformation generated on its manufacturing resources planning system flowed\\nelectronically from sales via manufacturing to despatch.\\nFrom the start Case fostered flexibility among its people.\\nDivisive practices were shunned in favour of free-for-all parking, a single\\ncanteen and monthly pay cheques. Team working and team problem-solving were\\nencouraged.\\nAgainst all this was the threat posed by competitors in the quickly-changing\\nelectronics industry in the Asia Pacific region.\\nCase brings out about one new product every month and the life cycle of\\nthese products is only 10 months to two years. Margins are thin.\\nCase had the advantage of a reputation for product quality but knew it had\\nto offer its customers speedy and reliable delivery or they would go\\nelsewhere.\\nMr Kachellek is convinced that without the changes he started, Case would be\\nsub-contracting much of its manufacture to Asia Pacific. Only a small amount\\nhas been sub-contracted and, as manufacturing has improved, some of that is\\nlikely to brought back to the UK.\\nCase's products are turned out in nine days. Work in progress on the factory\\nfloor is worth about Pounds 300,000 compared with 10 times that amount three\\nyears ago. In other words, the factory is much easier to control.\\nMr Kachellek insists that his managers and staff in the factory solved most\\nof Case's manufacturing problems. Like many manufacturers these days, he\\ndownplays the role of technology.\\nThere have been no large additions to its manufacturing management system in\\nthe past three years, nor has there been large scale automation of the\\nshop-floor.\\nCase's biggest single investment in this period of change was the Pounds\\n22,000 it spent on a machine to insert integrated circuits into a printed\\ncircuit board.\\n'You don't have to spend lots of money on information technology,' says Mr\\nKachellek. 'It is easy to take the technology too far and we've done that in\\nthe past. Manufacturing should be simple and we all need to be reminded of\\nthat.'\\nSince 1988 Case has switched from a centrally run and organised factory to a\\ndistributed one. Again it is becoming the fashionable thing to do in\\nmanufacturing and it is supported by a similar move from central to\\ndistributed computing.\\nCase has separate areas for making printed circuit boards, cables, final\\nproducts and technical documentation. Each has its own stores. Office-bound\\nproduction planners no longer tell the factory floor what to make and when.\\nSupervisors decide their own schedule to meet the delivery dates given by\\nthe planners.\\nThis way of working has reduced lead times and late deliveries but, stresses\\nMr Kachellek, more was needed to reduce manufacturing costs.\\nJust over 70 people were made redundant three years ago. Since then a\\nfurther 150 people in manufacturing have left Case and not been replaced.\\nOnly 150 people remain in manufacturing.\\nIn the year to the end of March, Case reckons that its revenues have\\nincreased by about 15 per cent and that it is one of the few profitable\\ncompanies in the data communications business.\\nMr Kachellek makes no claims about manufacturing's part in this performance.\\nHe is not sure if Case's customers are satisfied but he knows he is not.\\nManufacturing improvements will continue at Case and, Mr Kachellek hopes, at\\nits suppliers.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-137': \"MANUFACTURING industry, in particular in the UK, has made large errors in\\nbuying computer hardware and software.\\nIt is not alone. Other sectors, such as retailing and finance, have also\\nmade their fair share of mistakes. However, with hindsight, manufacturing\\nshould to be able to invest more prudently. There are signs that this is\\nhappening.\\nThe biggest breakthrough for medium-sized and large manufacturers has been\\nrecognising what is needed for a successful computer system. It matters\\nlittle how rigorously the investment is justified or which manufacturing\\nsystem is chosen.\\nWhat is important, and obviously so, is having a happy group of users in\\nsales, purchasing, on the shop-floor and throughout the rest of the\\norganisation.\\nUsers are likely to be more satisfied if they are allowed to decide what\\nthey want from a system and are then involved in its selection and, finally,\\nare trained in its use. The steps are simple. They always have been but,\\nuntil recently, they have been by-passed.\\nThe reasons are complex but boil down to money and power. The justification\\nfor spending large sums on computer systems was much easier than it is\\ntoday. In the past, computers were mainly labour-saving devices and the cost\\nbenefits could be calculated quickly.\\nNow manufacturers want computer systems that are integrated and intelligent.\\nThey want the vast amount of information that they have collected on their\\nmainframe machines to be accessible to management to give an up-to-date\\npicture of the company's performance that can be viewed in any amount of\\ndetail.\\n'These are big projects where many of the benefits are intangible and it is\\nvery hard to put numbers on them,' says Mr Roderick Roy, a partner with\\nCoopers & Lybrand Deloitte's manufacturing consulting group. 'Companies have\\nto weigh up the risk of not doing it,' he adds.\\nFor very complex projects some large manufacturers are turning to financial\\nmodelling to determine the impact of their investment on the business.\\nThis is a lengthy process but there are PC-based computer programs to help\\nand, if these fail, the decision-makers have access to another well-used\\nmethod of investment justification. The method is described delicately as\\nbusiness acumen or, more coarsely, as gut-feel.\\nWhether the project is small or large, the most common failing in\\nmanufacturing is to underestimate the cost of implementation.\\nTypically, manufacturing systems for controlling inventory or production\\ntake a year or two before they are fully up and running. During that time\\nthe project has to be managed and people trained. Often neither happens to a\\ngreat enough extent.\\nInvestment in information technology should be equalled by the investment in\\nimplementation, insists Mr Alan Toplis, a partner with Price Waterhouse.\\n'If anyone tells you it is less, don't believe them. I've seen companies\\ndriven to the brink of bankruptcy because they couldn't implement their\\nsystems,' he says.\\nPower or the corporate pecking order has also stopped users getting what\\nthey want. Data processing departments, historically, have been closer to\\nthe financial director than production and, therefore, have had considerable\\ninfluence on a company's computer strategy.\\nMuch of the time they have dictated what hardware was needed and what\\nsoftware they would develop. When they were only responsible for jobs such\\nas payroll, pensions and sales order processing, it was of minor concern to\\npeople running the factory.\\nAll that changed when the processing departments started developing\\nmanufacturing resources planning packages for their mainframe computers.\\nThey were convinced that these packages could cut the cost of manufacture by\\nreducing, among other things, inventory, work-in-progress and lead times.\\nSome of these systems have been successful. However, many have not.\\nMr Brian Entwistle, general manager of British Aerospace's software\\ndevelopment arm, BAeCam, blames the processing department's liking for\\nmainframes which could not (and still cannot) process information fast\\nenough for it to reflect the realities on the shop-floor.\\nA parallel argument is that the department should not have been trying to\\ncomputerise the complexities of the shop-floor. Rather that manufacturing\\nshould have simplified its operations first.\\nSo the divide between the processing department and manufacturing has been\\ncreated.\\nIt has been maintained by the large computer suppliers which have the ears\\nof important people in the processing department and a vested interest in\\nexpanding the centralised mainframe strategy.\\nIt has also been supported by top management which operated, like the\\ncomputer systems, in an hierarchical manner.\\nBridging the gulf has been a lengthy job. It required people to admit they\\nhad made mistakes and management to take back the control of its computer\\nsystems' investments which it had relinquished to the processing department.\\nSome manufacturers have quietly done this.\\nHowever, the numbers that are clinging to the old way are sufficiently large\\nfor disaster stories to abound.\\nMost of the tales of woe have a common theme: in-house software development.\\nThe issue is rarely whether or not the spending was justified and benefits\\nenumerated.\\nAlmost always it is the processing department's insistence that\\nmanufacturing's requirements can only be met by bespoke software.\\nFor most commercial and basic manufacturing applications there is now 'very\\nlittle justification for developing your own software', says Mr Toplis.\\nGeneric packages typically match about 80 per cent of a company's\\nrequirements. The most up-to-date packages can then be tailored (in\\nconsultation with the users) to deliver much or all of the rest.\\n'They work,' says Mr Roy. 'They also strip years off the implementation\\nprocess which pulls all the benefits forward.'\\nIf manufacturing is to get any satisfaction from its computer investments\\nthe relationship between the board, the processing department and users,\\nespecially in the factory, must change.\\nIt is fashionable to knock the company's information technology people\\n(sometimes rightly so) for their dictatorial attitude. But, equally, the\\npeople running the factory have been silent in their suffering.\\nThe processing department should offer a service to the users and 'provide a\\nframework in which they can operate', says Mr Roy. Users should be prepared\\nto be more vocal about what they want and their working procedures.\\nManagement should minimise the fear of change and of admitting mistakes\\namong its staff.\\n'More than ever it is important for manufacturers to learn from the past,\\nsays Mr Roy.\\nFormal audits after a computer system has been running for a couple of years\\nwill pinpoint what has and has not been achieved (from the users'\\nperspective).\\nThey have not been favoured in the past, again because people were reluctant\\nto reveal the reality of their decisions. But, as the rate of change of\\ncomputer technology quickens, manufacturers can guarantee that they will be\\ngoing through another systems buying cycle in a few years.\\nArmed with this type of information and a multi-disciplined working group\\nwith access to the board, selecting the right system for the users will not\\nbe easy but it will have a better chance of success.\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n            Trends in expenditure on manufacturing management\\n                   applications by sector (UK Pounds m)\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nIndustry                   Last 12 months     Next 12 months\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMechanical Engineering           98.3            102.9\\nInstrument Engineering           85.7             27.3\\nElec./ Elec.

       " 'FT911-138': \"computer-aided design and manufacturing equipment - may be slowing down, but\\nmany users in manufacturing industry would give their eye teeth to match the\\ngrowth rates projected for suppliers over the next few years.\\nAfter the phenomenal growth of the early 1980s, the industry is expanding at\\nrates of a mere 10-14 per cent a year, depending on the sector. According to\\nDataquest, the US market research company, the total Cadcam market was worth\\nDollars 13.9bn last year, but this is forecast to rise to Dollars 26.2bn by\\n1995.\\nMost big Western manufacturing companies have Cadcam systems, although the\\nlevel of maturity and sophistication varies from one country or industrial\\nsector to another. While this means that some markets will see only\\nincremental growth, there is little doubt that customers with successful\\ninstallations are keen to come back and buy more.\\nMuch of the growth in the next few years, therefore, will come from a\\ncombination of new products and new applications to tempt long-standing\\nusers, and new customers.\\nIn the latter category some UK machine tool companies, for example, are only\\nnow replacing their draughtsman's tables with Cad systems, partly because\\nthe cost of the hardware is falling but also because their clients demand\\nit. As with robotics, the use of Cadcam is spreading to smaller\\nmanufacturing companies, and particularly the subcontractors in the\\nautomotive and aerospace industries.\\nMr Roger Smedley, chairman of the UK engineering design company Ricardo\\nInternational, remarks that 10 years ago it was hard to spend more than\\nPounds 1,000 per head in capital on each employee's drawing board, desk and\\nchair.\\nNow, with some computer screens costing up to Pounds 60,000 including\\nsoftware, capital expenditure per head has rocketed, but an enormous number\\nof design companies have gone out of business because they could not finance\\na switch to computers or make it work, says Mr Smedley. Ricardo is spending\\nPounds 1.5m a year on computers, while one of its rivals, Worthing-based\\nInternational Automotive Design, has just ordered an Pounds 800,000 CADDS 4X\\nsystem from Computervision, enhancing its ability to provide design, build\\nand prototyping services to big automotive manufacturers.\\nIAD has been a customer of Computervision, one of the world's leading Cadcam\\nsuppliers, for six years. Mr Mark Holmes, a UK marketing consultant for\\nComputervision, notes that manufacturers such as Rover and Ford are asking\\ntheir supplier companies to ensure their Cadcam systems are compliant - a\\ntrend that is being driven by the desire for concurrent engineering (design\\nfor manufacturing.)\\nComputervision, part of Prime Computer, is one of a handful of big players\\nin an industry which continues to see new niche products and companies\\nemerging, and thus boasts dozens of companies with revenues so small that\\nthey hardly register at all. Most of these are US companies, followed by\\nEuropean groups, with Japan back in third place.\\nIndustry observers see a continuing role for the smaller companies, even if\\nsometimes it is only for their technology to be obtained by the larger\\nplayers, through an OEM arrangement or acquisition.\\nAn example of the latter was the acquisition by Computervision of\\nMassachusetts-based Premise, whose technology extends Cadcam back to the\\nsketching, or back-of-an-envelope stage in the creation of a design. This\\nprocess, known as conceptual engineering, is generating widespread interest\\namong manufacturers.\\nThere have been takeovers of a different kind. The squeeze on margins in the\\nlate 1980s, caused by the rush into the market in the hope of fat profits,\\nhas left several companies by the wayside.\\nThe electronic design automation (EDA) sector in particular experienced\\nparticular turmoil during this period: Daisy Systems bought Cadnetics in\\n1988 to form Dazix, but a heavy burden of debt led to its bankruptcy filing\\nin August. In January, the much stronger US company Intergraph snapped up\\nDazix for Dollars 14m.\\nIf the established companies play their cards right, they ought to be able\\nto avoid Dazix's fate. There are significant opportunities in many\\ngeographic and product markets, and the big suppliers with marketing muscle\\nare best placed to exploit them.\\nMr Jim Tully, Dataquest's UK Cadcam analyst, sees Europe maintaining its 35\\nper cent share of the world market through to 1995. Germany is already the\\nbiggest market, but still offers the best growth potential because of\\nreunification. Reconstruction, refitting of factories and a modernised power\\nnetwork all offer scope for Cadcam sales.\\nDataquest predicts the more mature US market will see its share slip from 35\\nper cent in 1990 to 33 per cent in 1995, while Asia will maintain its 28 per\\ncent share.\\nIn product sectors, Mr Tully sees the fastest growth in the geographic\\ninformation systems (GIS) sector, where Intergraph is the undisputed leader.\\n'There's a great deal of interest in getting maps on to computer systems,'\\nhe says.\\nThe mechanical sector, which is by far the largest, is growing very slowly,\\nbut even here there are opportunities. In particular, users in this sector\\nare interested in so-called knowledge-based applications of Cadcam. An\\nexample is a system developed by the small US supplier Rasna, which will\\ndesign products such as car bumpers virtually automatically, minimising\\nweight and performing stress analysis on the basis of a few parameters and\\ncriteria.\\nTwo other trends look like becoming increasingly significant for the\\nindustry. Until recently, most Cadcam systems have been mutually\\nincompatible, and end-users wishing to change their system have faced a\\ndifficult and costly process. This, says Mr Tully, is changing, because of\\n'frameworks,' a set of software facilities that allows third-party Cadcam to\\nbe integrated into a user's existing system, or a supplier's product line.\\n'The whole issue of opening the systems up is the key to a lift to growth,'\\nhe says.\\nMr Holmes at Computervision sees another market place opening up -\\nengineering data management.\\nCadcam, he says, was a reasonably controlled environment in the early 1980s\\nwith the host mainframes looking after files. But as engineering companies\\nhave been forced to move more quickly, it has become more important to find\\nwhere information resides in a company.\\nChanging technology has meant that Cadcam is more likely to be based on a\\nworkstation, leading to a proliferation of files, and the need for EDM to\\ncontrol data more closely.\\nThere is probably no better way of assessing the industry's prospects than\\nto examine new uses for Cadcam. At Boeing, the introduction of a new\\ngeneration of Cad tools is aimed at eliminating the risk of design mistakes.\\nThe lynch-pin is Catia, a three-dimensional Cad programme supplied by\\nDassault Systems of France, which incorporates a new stress analysis system.\\nLinked to a network of IBM workstations and mainframes, Catia will enable\\nBoeing's new 777 commercial jet to be the first designed completely on\\ncomputer.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-139': \"IN the beginning there were machine tools, the workhorses of every\\nmechanical engineering workshop in the world, which are used for cutting,\\ngrinding and shaping lumps of metal to form components for all sorts of\\nindustrial products or machinery.\\nThen, over the past 25 years, came numerical control and computer numerical\\ncontrol (CNC), in the form of user-friendly units attached to the machine\\ntool which can be part-programmed on line by the operator or off-line in the\\nproduction engineering office.\\nHand-in-hand with the CNC units, whose software can control almost any type\\nof machine tool, new designs of machine produced the higher precision,\\nstiffness and stability to take advantage of the greater accuracy that CNC\\noffers.\\nCNC, when applied to single machine tools, is well-established, and more\\nthan 80 per cent of Japanese machine tools are numerically-controlled. The\\nunits are powerful enough to control 'machining centres', which can often do\\nthe work of eight or more standard machine tools, and may contain more than\\n100 different cutting tools.\\nAs the cost of computing power has come down, the economics of computer\\nmemory storage have been transformed, and CNC units can store and recall\\nhundreds of different instructions for a great variety of workpieces.\\nFrom the mid-1980s, further developments in CNC technology have produced the\\nconcept of a 'flexible manufacturing system' (FMS), two or more machining\\ncentres linked and coupled under the control of a host computer. The\\nimportant word is 'flexible,' according to the UK Machine Tool Technologies\\nAssociation: 'The combined power of the machine and host computer, and their\\nstorage memories, is enough to manufacture all prescribed varieties of work,\\nin any order.'\\nFMS is now being being linked to computer-aided design and production\\ncontrol to produce manufacturing industry's Holy Grail, Computer Integrated\\nManufacturing (Cim).\\nThe aim is to link 'islands of automation' on the factory floor with all the\\nother computerised functions of the manufacturing process, such as\\npurchasing, ordering, stock control and is proving to be a tougher challenge\\nthan many in the computer industry had predicted only three years ago.\\nPut at its simplest, there appears to be considerable confusion among\\nmanufacturers about how integrated their approach to Cim should be, or how\\nflexible their use of FMS. The situation is not helped by a proliferation of\\ncomputer suppliers, all keen to sell their product but varying in their\\ncommitment to service and support.\\nDr Norman Schofield, director of engineering and systems at PA Consulting\\nGroup, says there are very good technical reasons why Cim has been difficult\\nfor many companies to achieve.\\nCompanies had believed that, to stay competitive, they needed to buy the\\nbest available computers for each of the many different disciplines in the\\nmanufacturing process - packaging, software, documentation, electronics and\\nmechanical engineering.\\nThis, in turn, increased the size and complexity of the 'data package'\\ndescribing the product, and spread the data over many systems.\\nIn one recent assignment, PA found 41 different applications used in a\\ncompany's design/engineering process alone, on six different computer\\nplatforms, on 10 sites in three countries.\\nThe problem for the manufacturer, says Dr Schofield, is whether it is going\\nto get independent advice from any of its computer suppliers if it wishes to\\nintegrate its systems. PA has attempted to help clients through the maze by\\nbuilding its own Cim centre using four computers and 12 software\\napplications from nine different suppliers.\\nThe aim is to illustrate the many elements involved in applying Cim to the\\nrelatively simple task of putting parts on to printed circuit boards.\\nDr Schofield believes that open systems will be the key to developing\\nprogress towards Cim, and says most computer vendors are prepared to accept\\nthe inevitability of an open environment.\\n'Manufacturers are getting a lot more help from suppliers, which is all\\nleading to easier integration.'\\nHowever, he says manufacturers can help solve their integration problems\\nthemselves in two ways.\\nThe first goes back to the machine tool itself: manufacturers, if they have\\nthe clout, can insist that all their machine tool suppliers install the same\\ncontroller.\\nSecondly, manufacturers have to accept that integrated systems can be too\\nheirarchical. 'Where you can have autonomy (in a flexible manufacturing\\nsystem, for example) you should let it happen. Some failed systems have\\ntried to make things too rigid.'\\nIndeed studies of the influence of FMS in the US since the mid-1980s have\\nshown that it is often a misnomer, since the system may be inflexible in its\\ndesign and the way in which it is used. Also several reports have claimed\\nthat systems installed in the US lack the flexibility of those in Japan.\\nA recent report on the US FMS market by Frost & Sullivan, the market\\nresearch publishers, says worldwide competition is forcing adoption of\\nflexible manufacturing in a variety of industries, but is becoming\\nincreasingly important to batch-oriented manufacturers as product\\nlife-cycles shorten and product changes become more frequent.\\nF & S forecasts that sales of FMS equipment will rise from Dollars 266m in\\n1990 to Dollars 559m in 1995 (in constant 1990 dollars).\\nThe biggest obstacle to installing equipment is price, and more companies\\nwill be starting with the more limited flexible manufacturing cells (FMCs).\\nIn the UK, British Aerospace has taken a novel approach to Cim by developing\\nits own manufacturing control system, Cimitar, which provides a\\nsophisticated computerised link between management information systems and\\nshop-floor controllers.\\nBAe began the Cimitar programme in 1983 after discovering that computer\\ncompanies could not satisfy its large-scale requirement for shop-floor\\ncontrol systems. A separate company, BAeCAM, was set up in 1988 to develop\\nand market Cimitar worldwide, but Mr Brian Entwhistle, general manager, says\\nit was decided from the start to develop a generic product that could be\\nsold on the open market.\\nCimitar, which uses DEC's Vax hardware, is in use throughout BAe but BAeCAM\\nrecently signed up Caterpillar, the US construction equipment group, as a\\nuser. Mr Entwhistle hopes this will provide a reference for further US\\nsales.\\nBAeCAM has also installed part of Cimitar on to an IBM PC that runs a\\nmachine tool at BAe, elevating it from the normal download of data and\\nselection of tools and satisfying the need for complex communications\\nbetween the tools and the host computer.\\nAs companies continue to grapple with the challenges of Cim, and consultants\\nto explain them, its ascendancy is being challenged by another acronym, Pim,\\nproduct information management, alternatively known as EDM, engineering data\\nmanagement. Dr Charles Clarke of London-based Random Computing says that,\\njust as Cim was the catalyst for integrating manufacture, so Pim forces the\\nuser to understand the existing process before being able to manage it or\\nuse it.\\nThe characteristics of Pim/EDM, which has also been described as a short cut\\nto Cim via Cadcam, include data management and control and data navigation\\nmechanisms, but the aim is enterprise-wide control of information.\\nThis, says Dr Charles Clarke, liberates the user and allows true concurrent\\nengineering - designing a product and allowing its manufacture\\nsimultaneously - for the first time.\\n'It links the islands of automation that yesterday's manufacturing industry\\nnurtured and constrains the 'paper flow' monster with its attendant\\nroad-blocks and bottle-necks,' he says with an enthusiasm for metaphor\\nrarely found in studies of computers in manufacturing.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-140': \"MANUFACTURING methods have changed profoundly in the US and Europe over the\\npast few years. The adoption of total quality control and just-in-time\\ntechniques have proven necessary to compete with Japanese manufacturers,\\nwhose fundamentally different approach has set standards of efficiency and\\nquality Western manufacturers are still striving to emulate.\\nA comparative study of motor car manufacture in the US and Japan published\\nrecently by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology makes the point\\npowerfully. General Motors' plant in Framingham in the US takes 31 hours to\\nassemble a car. There are 135 defects in every 100 cars and a two week\\ninventory of parts.\\nToyota's Takaoka plant in Japan produces a car every 16 hours with on 45\\nfaults per 100 cars. Its inventory is sufficient to sustain production for a\\nmere two hours.\\nThe West's struggle to compete with Japan's growing manufacturing\\nsuperiority has been marked by false starts and expensive excursions up\\ntechnological blind alleys.\\nWestern companies failed initially to understand the nature of the\\ndifference in manufacturing philosophies, believing that low labour costs\\nand heavy use of technology were the answer.\\nIn fact, with the appreciation of the yen, Japan's labour costs are not all\\nthat different from its Western competitors. Japanese manufacturers\\ncertainly use computers but sparingly, preferring to design their products\\nto suit them for manufacture, rather than the other way about.\\nThey build quality into their products rather than inspect later for faults.\\nResponsibility for quality control is entrusted to the production worker\\nrather than the Western-style quality control department.\\nIncreasingly, the trend is to parallelism or concurrent engineering, where\\ncustomer requirements, product design, manufacturing technology and cost\\naccountancy proceed in parallel and information is continuously fed back to\\nmodify the manufacturing processes.\\nThese ideas of design for manufacture and respect for the contribution\\nindividuals can make to manufacturing quality permeate Japanese\\nmanufacturing methods.\\nThey are now diffusing to the West and are the essential backcloth against\\nwhich the growing use of computers in manufacturing must be seen.\\nComputer systems for manufacturers are supplied by computer makers rather\\nthan traditional machine tool companies.\\nHardware comes from companies such as IBM, ICL, Digital Equipment, Hewlett\\nPackard, and Bull Software is supplied by companies such as Istel\\nAutomation, Kewill Systems and Prime Computers among a host of others. All\\nagree that with most Western economies exhibiting weakness, if not actual\\nrecession, business is tough: 'but not as bad as it's made out to be'\\naccording to Mr Peter Willis of IBM.\\nMr Graham McKenzie, technical unit manager for Digital Equipment in the UK\\nsays that buyers are focusing on the business benefits of installing\\ncomputer systems.\\nThe industry is not helped by the continuing difficulty the accountancy\\nprofession has found in cost justifying investment in modern computer\\nequipment.\\nA detailed study of the US valve industry by Dr Peter Weill called Do\\nComputers Pay Off?, (ICIT Press, 1990) concluded that the relationship\\nbetween computer investment and manufacturing was circular: 'It was not\\npossible to identify the unique contribution of any particular year of IT\\ninvestment. It is not clear that this can ever be achieved statistically'.\\nThe advent of the microprocessor, by making available virtually unlimited\\ncomputer power at low cost, has given manufacturers a wide range of\\npowerful, computer-based technologies which can be deployed on the factory\\nfloor as well as the back office.\\nThere is computer aided design (Cad), pioneered by aerospace and computer\\nmanufacturers, which provides not only an electronic drawing board, but also\\nproduct design information.\\nComputer aided engineering (CAE) automates the design process making it\\npossible to test the validity of a design before moving to the prototype\\nstage.\\nComputer aided manufacturing (Cam) involves a range of intelligent\\nshop-floor machinery including robots, numerically controlled machine tools,\\nflexible manufacturing centres and automated handling systems.\\nMuch of this is taken for granted. Mr Brian Small, managing director of\\nIngersoll Engineers, a UK manufacturing consultancy, says that manufacturing\\ncomputers today look like and are bought like conventional machine tools.\\nConvenience and simplicity of purchase does not guarantee success in\\noperation however and there are serious dangers in assuming that\\nmanufacturing problems yield to an injection of technology.\\nThe Strathclyde Institute, an independent manufacturing consultancy warns in\\na recent report: 'Many people equate improved competitiveness in manufacture\\nwith the application of state-of-the-art technology such as powerful\\ncomputer systems, MRP, Cad and robotics. While it may be advantageous or\\nnecessary for a company to apply these and other enabling technologies in\\npursuit of excellence, this should only be as part of an overall company\\nstrategy.'*\\n'If such technologies are applied to a company without cognisance of the\\nneeds or effects on other areas, at present or in the future, then it may be\\ndifficult if not impossible to integrate the patchwork of systems across the\\ncompany.'\\nIntegration is the important word in manufacturing automation. The goal for\\nforward looking companies is computer integrated manufacture (Cim), an\\noverused piece of jargon with many definitions.\\nOne comprehensive definition from the Strathclyde Institute is: 'an amalgam\\nof computer aided engineering and drafting, computer aided manufacturing,\\nflexible manufacturing systems, tooling and quality support systems,\\nin-process gauging and automated final inspection, automated storage and\\nmaterials handling, and operations control within a business information\\nsystem.'\\nMr Willis of IBM warns, however, that too often the 'i' in Cim stands for\\ninterconnection rather than integration. There has to be, he explains, an\\nunderlying Cim architecture: 'To complete a 1,000-piece jigsaw, you have to\\nhave all the pieces and a picture on the box.' There is probably not a\\nsingle true Cim operation anywhere in the world.\\nCell manufacture is emerging as one of the biggest steps towards integrated\\nmanufacture. A survey by Ingersoll Engineers** suggests that over half of\\nthe UK's engineering companies have implemented cell manufacture in some\\npart of their business.\\nCells are self-contained manufacturing units with the machines, controls,\\npeople and support needed to make a finished product complete with payment\\nschemes, incentives, performance measurements and accountability.\\n'Well over 90 per cent of manufacturers who have implemented cells have seen\\nan improvement in performance and 40 per cent describe the improvement as\\nsignificant. Fewer than 2 per cent have abandoned the approach,' says\\nIngersoll.\\nComputer technology has a part to play in the flow of information necessary\\nto support and underpin these developments.\\nSuccessful manufacturers in the 1990s, however, will emphasise the human\\ndimension: 'What do you need to do the job?' will replace the order 'Look\\nafter that machine]'\\n*Computer Integrated Manufacture for the Engineering Industry, The\\nStrathclyde Institute 1990, Financial Times Business Information, 071-799\\n2002.\\n**Competitive Manufacturing - the quiet revolution, Ingersoll Engineers,\\n1990, 0926 427088.\",\n",

       " 'FT911-154': \"Any revival of mergers and acquisitions activity in the US could renew\\ninterest in a family of financial instruments headed by CVRs - contingent\\nvalue rights - which offer investors protection against a poorly performing\\nstock price.\\nWhile just a handful of contingent financial instruments were issued in the\\nbull market of the late 1980s, interest could be stronger this time around\\nthe economic cycle.\\nThe company issuing the CVR targets a future share price and promises to pay\\nthe holder the difference between the target price and the actual share\\nprice at the exercise date, subject to an upper limit.\\nHence the company may face a substantial liability if its shares do not\\nreach the target price.\\nAlternatively, if the shares perform well, the CVRs expire worthless.\\nIn the US, CVRs were originally issued following the mergers which formed\\nthe pharmaceutical groups Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Marion Merrell Dow in\\n1989.\\nFor example, Dow Chemical will pay the holders of its CVRs the difference\\nbetween Dollars 45.77 and the price of Marion Merrell Dow shares in\\nSeptember this year - up to a maximum payment of Dollars 15.77 or Dollars\\n1.5bn in total.\\nLast week Marion Merrell Dow shares were trading at Dollars 34 per share,\\nimplying a Dollars 11-per-CVR, or Dollars 1bn, liability.\\nHowever, Dow Chemical has the option of extending the deadline by one year,\\nin which case the target share price rises to Dollars 50.23 and the maximum\\npayment Dollars 20.23.\\nThe acquiring companies view the CVR liability as something akin to a\\ndeferred consideration, which is revealed in a note to the annual report and\\naccounts.\\n'From the predators' perspective, these are instruments which offer a kind\\nof earn-out to stockholders in the company which is being taken over,' said\\nMr Ben Krause, head of the capital markets group at the American Stock\\nExchange in New York, on which both the Dow and Rhone-Poulenc CVRs are\\nlisted.\\nThis type of profits participation role was even more obvious in an earlier\\nissue of contingent payment rights for Eli Lilly. These instruments gave\\nholders the right to profits participation following the Dollars 350m\\nacquisition of Hybritech in 1986.\\nIn part, CVR issues were driven by an accounting loophole, which allowed the\\ndominant partners in the merger - Rhone-Poulenc and Dow Chemical - to keep\\ngoodwill resulting from the transaction off the merged entities' balance\\nsheet. This is particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry, where\\nvaluations of companies are well in excess of asset value, reflecting the\\nfuture value of drugs still in the research and development phase.\\nThe amortisation of goodwill arising from mergers would severely depress the\\nprofits of the merged entity.\\nThe US accounting loophole has now been closed, but CVRs have not\\ndisappeared from the corporate finance scene.\\nContingent participation rights - whether based on profits performance or\\nshare price performance - could be used as a defence against takeover by\\nguaranteeing holders a minimum return on investment.\\nNCR, the US computer manufacturer, reportedly considered issuing CVRs as a\\ndefence against AT&T's hostile bid. Consolidated Goldfields also considered\\nmaking a CVR issue as a defence against Minorco.\\nThere certainly seems to be an appetite among international investors for\\ninstruments which offer some form of protection against a poorly performing\\nshare price.\\nFor example, Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, decided to issue\\nunusual 'bull spread' warrants rather than ordinary equity warrants in a\\nDollars 1bn issue in April.\\nJust like CVRs, the 'bull spread' warrant structure offers protection\\nagainst a collapse in the share price over the next three years - but at the\\ncost of limiting annual returns.\\nThe warrants were issued when Roche shares were trading at around SFr7,500.\\nOn the exercise date in May 1994, holders of the warrants can either take\\none Roche share, a cash payment of SFr7,000, or, at the companies\\ndiscretion, a cash payment of SFr10,000.\\nThere certainly seems to be a future for contingent financial instruments in\\none form or other. However, the permutations are many and the risks to the\\nissuing company could be significant. Corporate financiers make two points:\\nThe promise to compensate for poor share price growth, and therefore\\npresumably for poor earnings growth, is only credible if the issuer is a\\nstrong company. Roche, Dow Chemical, Rhone-Poulenc and Eli Lilley are all\\nsolid blue-chip stocks. However, the roster of potential issuers is limited\\nto larger corporations able to weather a downturn in performance.\\nOnly a brave company would target its share price in the current uncertain\\neconomic climate. The experience of convertible bonds incorporating a put\\noption - which allows the holder to cash in the bonds early - may have been\\nchastening.\",\n",

       " 'FT911-169': \"IT SEEMED a good idea at the time. In the bull market of 1987 a number of\\ncompanies issued convertible Eurobonds.\\nThey took advantage of rising share prices to set conversion prices at well\\nabove their then share prices.\\nFurther, they shaved the interest payments on the bonds by offering\\ninvestors the right to redeem them, usually after five years, at a premium\\nto the issue price.\\nThis would guarantee the bondholders a return roughly in line with interest\\nrates at the time.\\nBut, the issuers thought, these put options were never going to be\\nexercised. By the time they were due, the share price would have risen, the\\nbonds would have been converted.\\nThe companies would have issued equity, and they hoped, the holders of the\\nnew shares would have been drawn from the pool of international investors\\nwho buy Eurobonds, thus widening the shareholder base.\\nNow it is all too obvious that there was a flaw in this logic.\\nThe stockmarket crash of October 1987 meant that the share prices of many\\ncompanies fell well below the conversion prices. Suddenly the put option,\\nwhich had seemed unimportant, loomed as a potential liability.\\nAs 1992 approached, the year when many of these options become payable,\\ncompanies realised they had problems. Unfortunately many of them also fell\\non difficult times.\\nThe prospect of a large liability worsened the outlook for companies already\\nfacing poor trading conditions, or reaping the whirlwinds of ill-judged\\nexpansions.\\nCertainly it was not the instrument itself which was at fault, but the\\nmistakes of the issuers.\\nThe existence of a convertible with a put option became enough, in some\\ncases, to trigger a bear raid on the company's shares.\\nIn the case of Saatchi & Saatchi, the advertising group, with its Pounds\\n176.5m convertible Europreference shares due to be redeemed for Pounds 211m\\nin July 1993, the liability would have been sufficient to put the company\\ninto receivership.\\nNow most of issuers have found an answer, if not a solution, to the problem.\\nThese answers range from conversion as planned, to a complete refinancing of\\nthe company.\\nThe essence of any such answer is to give the issuer the ability to meet any\\nlikely redemption without straining its balance sheet.\\nTHE WHAT PROBLEM\\nSOLUTION\\nLast year Tesco, the food retailer, was able to force its convertible\\nholders to convert to shares because the group's share price had risen well\\nabove the conversion price.\\nThis is the ideal answer, since it was the outcome intended when the bonds\\nwere first issued. The company has in effect borrowed cheaply for three\\nyears - Tesco's convertible paid interest at 4 per cent - and has increased\\nits share capital at a price higher than it was at the time of issue.\\nTHE GRIN AND\\nBEAR IT ANSWER\\nMany issuers have decided there is nothing for it but to pay up if or when\\nthe put is exercised.\\nMost are providing for the extra interest which would be due, adding to\\ntheir interest charges, with the provision usually accumulating in creditors\\nin the balance sheet.\\nThus, if a put option is exercised, there should not be a sudden charge to\\nprofits, although the cash will have to be found and the bond refinanced.\\nProviding is not an answer on its own, issuers must also find the cash for\\nredemption.\\nOne side effect of making the provision is that, as Tesco discovered, having\\nset supplemental interest against its profits, it could only bring the\\nprovision back into reserves, not profits, in its latest balance sheet.\\nTHE BUY-BACK\\nWith many of the convertible bonds trading well below their issue prices,\\ncompanies have been able to buy some of them back, cutting their liability\\non exercise of the put. Storehouse and Next, the retailers, have both tried\\nthis route. Not surprisingly, bonds which have been languishing suddenly\\nspring to life when a company announces a buy-back programme, so issuers\\ncannot always retrieve much of the issue.\\nStorehouse was able to buy Pounds 40.5m of its Pounds 69m convertible issue\\nlast autumn. It even made a Pounds 400,000 profit on the transaction. That\\nleaves only Pounds 28.5m of the issue outstanding, which will cost the\\ncompany Pounds 36.8m in April 1992 if the put is exercised, much less than\\nthe original liability of Pounds 89m.\\nNext has two issues outstanding, and has bought some of each, with purchases\\nof its larger 5 3/4 per cent bond made recently. It now has Pounds 78.6m of\\nthat issue outstanding, and Pounds 43.3m of its 6 3/4 per cent issue. That\\nwould present liabilities of Pounds 57.8m in January 1992 and Pounds 104.8m\\nin October 1992.\\nTHE SALE OF ASSETS\\nWAY OUT\\nCompanies which could not put off the liability, could at least prepare for\\nit by raising cash. Storehouse has reformed its balance sheet through asset\\nsales, and should have minimal net debt when its March 31 accounts are\\npublished. It should not have a problem in meeting the put in April 1992.\\nNext's sale of Grattan, its mail-order subsidiary, for Pounds 168m will give\\nit net cash until the October 1992 payment is made, and it now has agreed\\nfacilities from its banks.\\nTHE ROLLING PUT WHEEZE\\nCorporate financiers who had helped companies get into a mess by issuing the\\nbonds originally, tried to help them out by inventing the 'rolling put'.\\nThis idea was to put off the evil day by offering bondholders an attractive\\nincentive to stay with their investments. When the first put date arrived,\\nthey would be offered another put perhaps five years later at a new interest\\nrate.\\nAt first this seemed to excuse companies from providing for extra interest,\\nsince it once again reduced the likelihood of the put being exercised. But\\nnow many expect the first puts to be exercised. Burton, Hillsdown and Asda\\neach have rolling puts, but of these only Asda is now not providing\\nsupplemental interest. Each expects to have no financial difficulty meeting\\nthe redemption.\\nTHE RIGHTS ISSUE\\nREPLACEMENT\\nIf the bond is not to turn into shares, then a rights issue is another\\nanswer. That was London International Group's idea when it launched a Pounds\\n61.6m rights in January. That not only provides the cash to repay its Pounds\\n50m convertible in March 1992, it also increases the group's equity.\\nMeanwhile LIG is providing for the extra interest.\\nTHE TOTAL REFINANCING\\nDESPERATION MEASURE\\nSaatchi's problems were so severe that the only way out was to refinance the\\ngroup.

For the moment, at least, there is\\nno inclination to change tactics by striking boldly to capture a brewer such\\nas Allied-Lyons.\\n'We are quite willing to make investments in brewing assets abroad,' says Mr\\nRitter, 'so long as we can maintain our pattern of seeking a fair return on\\ncapital for shareholders.'\\nThe 'outrageous' prices paid over recent years for UK and European breweries\\nwould make that impossible.\\n'There will be opportunities later to buy assets, if necessary, at\\nreasonable prices,' he suggests.\\nAnheuser's international progress so far has been made mainly through\\nlicensing agreements with national brewers. These include Suntory in Japan,\\nits largest export market, GrandMet in the UK, Guinness in Ireland, Labatt\\nin Canada, Carlsberg in Denmark, and Oriental Brewing in South Korea.\\nSuch agreements have generally worked well. Budweiser is the leading\\ninternational brand in Japan with 60 per cent of the category.\\nIn Canada, it has captured 4 per cent of the beer market. Sales in Ireland\\ngrew 52 per cent last year; and in the UK, which accounts for 80 per cent of\\nits European sales of 657,000 hls annually, Budweiser is one of the fastest\\ngrowing premium lagers.\\nThe licensed brewers take a large share of the profits, however, and the\\nuncertainties of such agreements was illustrated by the acquisition of Grand\\nMetropolitan's breweries this year by Courage, the UK's second-largest\\nbrewer. Mr Ritter confesses that this deal, which put Anheuser's Budweiser\\nin the same portfolio as its US rival's Miller Lite, has caused 'very great\\nconcern'.\\nAnheuser is discussing the situation with Courage and seems to have decided\\nthat, because of Miller's different positioning as a standard lager, it may\\nbe able to live with the arrangement.\\nCourage, however, will have to provide some guarantees. 'The key factor,'\\nsays Mr Ritter, 'is the amount of attention that our brand will get. We have\\nto ensure that it does not come to be seen as just one in a herd of premium\\nlagers.'\\nAnheuser sees 'great opportunities' for the future in the UK and continental\\nEurope as the brewing industry restructures, trade barriers come down, and\\nformer communist states move to market-based economies.\\nIt is optimistic about resolving its long-standing trademark dispute with\\nCzechoslovakia's Budweiser brewery and perhaps developing some form of joint\\nventure.\\nTo strengthen its position in Europe generally, Anheuser established its own\\nsales, distribution, and marketing organisation covering 17 countries last\\nyear.\\nEuropean sales volumes promptly rose 20 per cent. Budweiser is now listed by\\nall the UK's leading brewers, and the foundations for future growth have\\nbeen reinforced by its introduction into Greece, Sweden and Belgium.\\n'By moving slowly, we have gained knowledge of, and experience in, foreign\\nmarkets without tying up significant capital,' says Mr Ritter.\\n'We feel confident that we now know the market inside out,' he adds. Bullish\\nwords, perhaps, but competitors may well detect an ominous note.\",\n",

       " 'FT911-188': \"Pigeons still fly and nest in the large aircraft hangar at the run-down\\nairport of Schoenefeld in what used to be East Berlin.\\nAlthough Lufthansa has spent DM20m (Pounds 6.7m) modernising the old hangar\\nto turn it into a maintenance base for Boeing 737 jets, the airline has so\\nfar failed to remove all the pigeons. The investment reflects both the\\nambitions and difficulties of Lufthansa, which, in the words of its chairman\\nMr Heinz Ruhnau, wants to transform Berlin into 'a new centre of European\\naviation and a gateway between east and west', following the unification of\\nthe two Germanys.\\nLufthansa returned to Berlin last October after a 45-year absence. It was an\\nemotional moment. The airline was founded in Berlin in 1926. After the\\nsecond world war, it was shut out from its home base with only the allied\\nairlines, including British Airways, Air France and Pan American, allowed to\\nuse the three air corridors between Berlin and what was West Germany.\\nThe German flag carrier has wasted little time in re-establishing itself in\\nBerlin. 'From zero, we now operate 286 weekly flights into Berlin,' said Mr\\nRuhnau, whose successor as Lufthansa chairman is expected to be announced\\ntomorrow. But the euphoria has been tempered by the practical difficulties\\nof the reunification process and, in the case of Lufthansa, of recreating a\\nbase in the city.\\nSchoenefeld is just one example. 'The hangar was in a dreadful state,' said\\nMr Karl-Friedrich Rausch, Lufthansa's manager for aircraft maintenance in\\nBerlin. He was walking around the maintenance plant which, until this year,\\nwas used by Interflug, the former East German airline which has just stopped\\nits scheduled flights. 'We called in the Rentokil people but there are still\\nsome pigeons left,' he added.\\nBut the pigeons are the least of Lufthansa's worries in trying to expand its\\noperations. The airline was planning to use Schoenefeld to launch new\\ninternational services from Berlin because there was no room for expansion\\nat the congested airport of Tegel in the former western part of the city.\\n'We started a service to New York this year but were forced to drop it. No\\none wanted to fly from Schoenefeld because of the state of the airport,'\\nexplained a Lufthansa official. Plans to improve and modernise Schoenefeld\\nare in limbo. Mr Ruhnau is now campaigning for the construction of an\\nairport 30 miles south of Berlin on the site of the present Soviet military\\nair base of Sperenberg. This would provide the necessary infrastructure to\\nmeet the expected growth in air travel demand in the Berlin area. Even if he\\nsucceeds in persuading the authorities, it will take years to build the\\nairport.\\nBerlin's problem is acute. At present Tegel handles nearly 7m passengers a\\nyear, while Schoenefeld serves about 3m passengers largely with flights\\noperated by east European carriers. 'By the year 2005, we expect demand in\\nBerlin to rise to about 30m,' Mr Ruhnau said. 'Tegel could be enlarged but\\nbecause it is in the middle of the city it cannot be expanded to handle more\\nthan 7m passengers a year. Schoenefeld could be expanded to serve 12m to 13m\\npassengers a year but faces big problems. Berlin basically needs a new\\nairport.'\\nBut it is not only the lack of adequate new airport capacity which risks\\nclipping Lufthansa's ambitions. The current state of disarray of the Soviet\\nand east European economies is expected to delay the development of\\neast-west air travel.\\nAs the national flag carrier, Lufthansa faces the additional political\\npressure of helping to provide employment and new economic opportunities for\\nformer East Germans. 'The wall has come down but a new economic poverty wall\\nhas been erected between the rich west and the poor eastern side,' said a\\nmember of the Berlin Senate.\\nMr Ruhnau originally proposed to acquire a 26 per cent stake in Interflug\\nand to absorb it gradually into the Lufthansa family. But the Treuhand, the\\nbody charged with selling or closing east German companies, as well as the\\nGerman cartel office were opposed to the deal because they feared it would\\ngive Lufthansa a monopoly in Berlin.\\nBritish Airways also showed an interest in buying a large stake in Interflug\\nto help preserve its position in the Berlin market after unification. But BA\\nwas never able to see the Interflug accounts to help it decide whether to\\nmake such an investment. Instead BA, now facing intense competition from\\nLufthansa on internal German airline services, plans to form a new\\nGerman-based airline with German banks and other financial institutions.\\nLufthansa was not prepared to wait for the Treuhand to change its mind and\\nallow it to buy a stake in Interflug. It decided to develop its new Berlin\\nhub alone. It bought for Dollars 150m the internal German services of Pan\\nAm, the US carrier desperate for cash; negotiated a new agreement with Air\\nFrance to take over the management of the joint Euro-Berlin airline\\nsubsidiary set up three years ago under French control to offer flights out\\nof Berlin; and launched a series of services to Germany and other\\ninternational destinations.\\nThe airline has hired almost 1,000 former Interflug employees, including 450\\nat its Schoenefeld maintenance facility, to staff its Berlin operations.\\n'I'm not responsible for Interflug but we have always tried to help the\\npeople of Interflug,' Mr Ruhnau said. But with the demise of the former East\\nGerman airline, Lufthansa is being pressed to hire more Interflug employees.\\nInterflug was heavily over-staffed like other East German enterprises. ' All\\nEast German companies had two chains of employment. One was the management,\\nthe other the party,' said Mr Ruhnau. 'At Interflug there were four chains:\\na secret service chain and an army chain as well.'\\nMore than 6,000 people were employed by Interflug. There are still about\\n2,800 who have yet to find new jobs. This includes 215 pilots. 'I don't know\\nhow it will be possible to retrain these pilots to fly western aircraft,' Mr\\nRuhnau said. However, Lufthansa has just set up a company to help retrain\\nInterflug employees with the backing and funding of Germany's national\\nemployment organisation.\\n'The company will make an offer to all employees still with Interflug to get\\nnew qualifications to give them a better chance of finding a job in the\\nairline or service-related industries. If air traffic in Berlin picks up and\\nwe have a demand for additional people, newly qualified Interflug employees\\nwill get priority,' Mr Ruhnau explained.\\nDespite the enormous economic uncertainties facing the fledgling eastern\\ndemocracies, and the current turmoil in the airline industry, Mr Ruhnau is\\nconvinced Lufthansa's strategy of expanding in both east and west Europe\\nwill ultimately pay off. He expects the east-west European airline market to\\nshow higher than average growth over the next 20 years, of 10.4 per cent a\\nyear, compared with about 5-6 per cent for the industry as a whole.\\n'We are already the market leader and we will strengthen our position\\nbecause all these countries are our neighbours and Germany already offers\\nthe majority of airline seats to east Europe,' he said. Lufthansa is now\\ndiscussing close co-operation with LOT, the Polish airline, and an agreement\\nis expected this summer.\\nMr Ruhnau has a long-term vision. 'The old expression of eastern and western\\nEurope will disappear in a few years,' he said. 'Before the war we had a\\ncontinental Europe or rather a middle Europe which was a source of great\\nwealth. This will appear again and Berlin will be in the middle of it.'\\n'Look,' he added, 'Czechoslovakia once had the highest living standard in\\nEurope. This will come again. History and tradition are much more important\\nthan some short-term thinking. All this opens new opportunities for\\nLufthansa.'\\nMost of his own senior managers are more cautious. At present, 90 per cent\\nof Berlin traffic is domestic German traffic, explained Mr Klaus Nittinger,\\nthe head of Lufthansa's passenger services. The international network out of\\nBerlin remains weak. 'The growth of this network will be gradual. The west\\nBerlin population is only 2m and cannot generate enough traffic to create a\\nbig market. The surrounding market is still pretty weak because the money is\\nnot there,' he added.\\nBut Mr Ruhnau believes he will confound the sceptics once more. At his\\ncompany's annual meeting in Berlin in 1984, he was ridiculed for saying:\\n'The day will come when Lufthansa will again fly to an undivided Berlin.'\\nEven if his latest prediction proves correct, Mr Ruhnau, who will be\\nretiring next year, will leave a formidable task for his successor.\",\n",

       " 'FT911-198': \"Any effort to lure new industry to rural Saskatchewan runs the risk of\\nending up as more of a repellent than a magnet.\\nFar away from North America's main markets, the farming towns which dot the\\nCanadian prairies are best known for their pancake-flat scenery and numbing\\nwinters.\\nBut in their quest for diversification, these remote communities have hit on\\na novel way to tempt small and mid-sized businesses into setting up or\\nexpanding on their doorstep.\\nTheir bargaining chip is a scheme of government-sponsored 'community bonds'.\\nLaunched last year, the bonds are designed to mobilise equity for local\\nenterprises, using the sizeable amounts of money which frugal prairie\\ntownsfolk and farmers have up to now squirrelled away in low-risk bank\\ndeposits and blue-chip shares.\\nSeveral businesses have already taken the bait. Trinitral International, a\\nsmall maker of telephone sets, expects to open a 17-person assembly and\\npackaging facility next month in the south-east Saskatchewan town of\\nMelville (population 5,000).\\nMelville's Community Bond Corporation raised CDollars 250,000 from local\\nresidents late last year, giving it a 25 per cent stake in Trinitral. Other\\nshareholders are a provincial government agency, the company's managers and\\nDorart Industries, a Singapore company which will supply kits and know-how\\nto Trinitral.\\nIn the town of Kindersley, near the Saskatchewan-Alberta border, a newly\\nformed community bond corporation hopes to rake in CDollars 500,000 over the\\nnext month or two. The money will be invested in Rotary Airforce, which is\\ndeveloping a slow-moving type of helicopter suitable for crowd control and\\npipeline inspections.\\nRotary's existing R&D operation is currently occupying aircraft hangars near\\nEdmonton, in neighbouring Alberta. The infusion of equity from community\\nbonds has led the company to set up its manufacturing facility in\\nKindersley.\\nOver 60 towns have registered community bond corporations in the past year.\\nThree financings have been completed, while ten other bond offerings are\\ncurrently under way. Other project companies include a maker of combine\\nharvester attachments and a pea-chip processing plant.\\nSome communities plan to use the corporations like mutual funds, first\\nraising money and then searching for one or more businesses which they would\\nlike to have in town.\\nThe key to the scheme is a guarantee provided by the provincial government\\non the principal amount of the bonds. In other words, local investors stand\\nto lose no more than the interest, dividends or capital gains which might\\nhave accrued elsewhere.\\nEven with this safeguard, however, the community bond scheme is fraught with\\nrisks. At least some of the businesses will almost certainly fail, which\\ncould leave the government with sizeable financial obligations, and local\\ncommunities with the political and economic scars of a serious misadventure.\\nSome community bond corporations, designed as vehicles for 'people's\\ncapitalism', may have difficulty functioning as sophisticated shareholders.\\nMany of the directors are neophytes in economic development. The 12-member\\nKindersley corporation, for instance, includes a local dentist and a farmer.\\nEach board must also appoint a 'youth director' under the age of 18.\\nThere is a nagging suspicion in some quarters that the provincial\\ngovernment, facing an election later this year, has launched the scheme with\\nan eye on popular appeal rather than sound commercial practice. One observer\\nnotes that 'there is quite a lot of nervousness among those close to the\\nprocess, compared with the euphoria of the politicians who are touting it'.\\nDespite these potential stumbling blocks, Dale Botting, regional manager for\\nthe Canadian Federation of Independent Business, thinks the scheme is worth\\na try. He expects that the government's total liability to holders of\\ncommunity bonds will turn out to be far lower than the millions of dollars\\nwhich it has poured into extravagant projects over the years.\\n'The real value of this may be to shore up the equity of businesses already\\nin the community and to encourage an entrepreneurial culture,' Botting says.\\nFor instance, Trinitral was able to get sufficient bank financing for its\\ntelephone set business only after it came up with the extra equity provided\\nby community bonds.\\nAmong other spin-offs, residents who volunteer to sell community bonds\\nreceive a short training course in the basics of investing in a small\\nbusiness. Students at the Saskatch-ewan College of Commerce can obtain\\ncourse credits by helping with administrative work in the corporations.\\nRick Dillabaugh, Kindersley's economic development officer, acknowledges\\nthat many of the bond-financed ventures will fail. But he contends that 'if\\nyou don't go out and try, you won't get the good ones either. This puts the\\ndestiny of the community into its own hands. They can choose what direction\\nthey want to take.'\\nThe proceeds of bond sales are normally invested in a company's preferred\\nshares, convertible into common stock after three to five years. In that\\nway, holders can benefit from increased dividends and capital gains, if\\nthere are any. Bond corporations have a right to nominate directors to the\\nboards of project companies proportionate to their equity stakes.\\nThe province is well aware of the risk that the scheme could degenerate into\\na gravy train for dubious ventures. Community bond corporations are\\nencouraged to hire a reputable accountant or lawyer to help them sift\\nthrough project proposals. Every investment must also be approved by a\\nsix-member provincial review committee, comprising two business lawyers, a\\nformer head of the provincial finance department, and three economic\\ndevelopment experts.\\nGraham Parsons, a government economist who claims credit for devising the\\nscheme and is now in charge of implementing it, reckons that the best\\nsafeguard is the board of directors of the bond corporations themselves.\\n'These people will be in the community for the next 10-20 years,' Parsons\\nsays. 'They have a significant responsibility to be fair and reasonable to\\nothers in the community.'\",\n",
       " 'FT911-199': \"Canada is searching for ways to breathe vigour into a popular federal\\nloan-guarantee programme for budding entrepreneurs which makes use of the\\nextensive resources of the country's financial institutions.\\nOver CDollars 7.7bn has been disbursed to about 285,000 businesses since the\\ninception of the Small Business Loans Act (SBLA) programme 30 years ago. In\\nthe year to March 1990, 13,800 loans were made with a value of CDollars\\n539m.\\n(The British government, meanwhile, has commissioned a review of the UK's\\nequivalent Loan Guarantee Scheme. This programme, which provides a 70 per\\ncent guarantee, has backed 27,900 loans worth Pounds 890m since 1981.)\\nThe SBLA's greatest strength, but one which is also turning out to be a\\nserious weakness, is the role of financial institutions in administering the\\nscheme. The loans are advanced by banks, trust companies and credit unions -\\ninstitutions that have branch networks and credit assessment skills which\\nthe government could not hope to match.\\nOttawa's role is to provide a guarantee on up to 85 per cent of the loan,\\nwith the financial institution taking the risk on the remaining 15 per cent.\\nAll loans must be secured, either by business or personal assets.\\nThe loans can be used to finance up to 90 per cent of land and premises\\ncosts, and 80 per cent of equipment costs, up to a CDollars 100,000 limit.\\nOnly companies with annual sales of less than CDollars 2m are eligible.\\nBanks are obliged to charge an interest rate equal to one percentage point\\nover bank prime rate, currently at 10 per cent in Canada. This compares with\\na typical rate for commercial loans of two or three points above prime.\\nThe scheme appears to have made a sizeable contribution in spawning new\\nenterprises. Almost 40 per cent of the SBLA loans made last year were for\\nstart-ups, while 60 per cent were for businesses less than three years old.\\nA study commissioned by the Canadian Bankers Association says that about 15\\nper cent of small-business loans are covered by an SBLA guarantee.\\nBut the volume of loans has slowed markedly in the past few years. Last\\nyear's total number of 13,800 was 22 per cent down on 1989. One reason is\\nthe recession. But the banks, more concerned than ever with their lending\\nmargins, also object to being forced to make loans at the set rate of prime\\nplus 1 per cent.\\nThe banks have come to see SBLA loans as something of a loss leader; they\\nconsider the chief benefit to be the other business they may generate from\\nthe borrowing company, its owners or its employees.\\nMichael Hanly, director of small business loans in the Department of\\nIndustry, Science and Technology, says that banks are increasingly taking\\nloans onto their own books which might in the past have been channelled\\nthrough the SBLA. 'We've got to make it more attractive for the banks,' he\\nsays.\\nAmong the changes now under consideration are a more flexible interest-rate\\nstructure (including perhaps, a service fee for the banks), and a higher\\nloan ceiling.\\nThe 88,000-member Canadian Federation for Independent Business is pressing\\nfor other adjustments, too. It suggests that the guarantee and interest-rate\\nformula could be tailored for specific groups of entrepreneurs, such as\\nwomen or disadvantaged minority groups.\\nIn return for market-related interest charges, the CFIB wants the banks to\\ncut back their personal security requirements. 'Our experience is that, even\\non conventional loans, the banks over-demand on collateral,' says Brian\\nGray, the CFIB's senior vice-president. The chances of the banks agreeing to\\nthat however, are small.\",\n",

(a)\\nthat matter was contained in the application for that other patent . . . and\\n(b) the priority date of that matter is earlier than that of the invention'.\\nLORD OLIVER said that the appeal arose from competing applications for\\npatents for chemical inventions in the field of genetic engineering.\\nA Japanese company, Dainippon, filed application JP 617 in Japan on March 6\\n1984. On April 6 1984 Asahi filed an application in the US. On February 26\\n1985 Dainippon filed application EP 549 in the European Patents Office\\nclaiming priority from JP 617. Asahi filed UK 864 on April 4 1985 claiming\\npriority from the US application of April 6 1984. For the purposes of the\\nappeal it was assumed that the subject matter of claims 2 and 3 of UK 864\\nwas matter disclosed in EP 549, and that EP 549 adequately described a\\nmethod of preparing the products of those claims.\\nIt was also assumed that the earliest EP 549 priority document (ie, JP 617)\\ndisclosed the products of claims 2 and 3 of UK 864, but did not describe any\\npreparation methods.\\nThe question, on those assumptions, was whether, having regard to the JP 617\\ndisclosure, the subject matter of claims 2 and 3 of UK 864 formed part of\\nthe state of the art under section 2 of the Patents Act 1977 at the UK 864\\npriority date, so as to deprive those claims of novelty.\\nThe question arose between Asahi and the comptroller of patents on\\nexamination of the application in suit, the UK 864 application.\\nOn February 16 1988 the superintending examiner determined that EP 549\\nformed part of the state of the art at the UK 864 priority date and thus\\nanticipated claims 2 and 3.\\nEP 549 was not published until September 1985, after the UK 864 priority\\ndate, so the examiner's decision was based on section 2(3) of the act and JP\\n617 priority.\\nAsahi argued that for disclosure in an application to form part of the state\\nof the art under section 2(3), it had to disclose the method of working the\\ninvention, ie, it had to be an 'enabling disclosure'. It said mere\\ndisclosure of a formula for a compound claimed was not sufficient.\\nThat argument was rejected by the superintending examiner. Mr Justice\\nFalconer dismissed Asahi's appeal. The Court of Appeal upheld that\\ndismissal. Asahi now appealed.\\nThe first question was, what material in EP 549 was entitled to the priority\\ndate of JP 617? The second question was whether that material anticipated\\nthe claims of the application in suit, having regard to the provisions of\\nsection 2.\\nSection 5(2)(a) of the act provided that if an invention to which an\\napplication related was 'supported by matter disclosed' in an earlier\\napplication, the invention priority date should be the date of filing the\\nearlier application. By section 5(2)(b) the priority date of 'any matter\\ncontained in the application in suit' was to be the date of filing the\\nearlier application in which 'that matter was disclosed'.\\nThe act did not contain any definition of 'supported', but some assistance\\ncould be obtained from section 14(5) which required the claim in an\\napplication to be 'supported' by the description.\\nThat must involve the conclusion that if the specification description did\\nnot enable the claim to be established, it could not be said to 'support'\\nit, for the act could hardly have contemplated a complete application for a\\npatent lacking some of the material necessary to sustain the claims made.\\nIt followed that a description in an earlier application which contained no\\nenabling disclosure would not 'support' the invention so as to enable it to\\nclaim priority from the date of that application under section 5(2)(a),\\nalthough the description would be entitled to a priority as 'matter\\ncontained' in the application in suit under section 5(2)(b).\\nWhat was claimed was a chemical compound formula produced in accordance\\nwith, and identified by reference to, the formula disclosed.\\nThe invention was not the formula itself but the thing identified and\\ndescribed in terms of chemical building blocks by reference to the formula\\nof its compositions.\\nThere might of course be cases where the means of producing the thing would\\nbe self-evident to the man skilled in the art from the mere recital of the\\nformula or its composition, but it was not suggested that this was such a\\ncase.\\nIt had, therefore, to be assumed for present purposes that the man skilled\\nin the art, if he was to produce the invention claimed, would need to know,\\nnot simply the formula, but a method by which it could be produced in\\naccordance with that formula. The invention, as a patentable concept,\\ninvolved the combination of formula and means.\\nIt followed, Asahi argued, that EP 549 could not claim under section 5(2)(a)\\npriority from JP 617 for the totality of the invention claimed, but it could\\nclaim priority from that application under section 5(2)(b) for the formulae\\ndisclosed. So far as the means of making the invention was concerned, it\\ncould claim priority only from the date of its own filing under section\\n5(1).\\nThe logic of that argument seemed unassailable.\\nNone of the relevant material had at priority date been published. The\\ncritical provision was section 2(3).\\nIn Genentech (1989) RPC 613 Mr Justice Falconer concluded that to constitute\\nanticipation to a claim to a new chemical compound, disclosure in a prior\\ndocument must be an enabling disclosure. In reaching that conclusion he\\nnecessarily disapproved a contrary decision in GKI (1958) RPC 51.\\nFor an anticipation under section 2(2) Genentech was to be preferred to GKI.\\nAsahi contended that the test was the same for section 2(3).\\nSection 2(3) deemed to be part of the state of the art nothing more than\\nmatter entitled to priority under section 5.\\nThus, the formula disclosed in JP 617 was deemed to be part of the state of\\nthe art, but it did not follow that the invention claimed in that\\napplication, ie, the compound produced by application of the formula, was\\npart of the state of the art so as to anticipate the claims made in UK 864.\\nThe only 'matter' disclosed was the bare claim that a compound could be\\nprepared of the specified composition.\\nThe appeal was allowed. The application was remitted to the Patent Office.\\nTheir lordships agreed. Lord Jauncey gave a concurring judgment.\\nFor Asahi: Simon Thorley QC and Guy Burkhill (Taylor Joynson Garrett\\nFor the comptroller: Nicholas Pumphrey QC (Treasury solicitor)\",\n",

In theory, the material offers inherent speed and power\\nadvantages. GaAs transistors are faster and consume less power than silicon\\ntransistors.\\nMaking GaAs chips has, however, proven to be far more difficult and\\nexpensive than expected. Only a handful of the two dozen or so start-up chip\\ncompanies created in the early 1980s to exploit GaAs technology have\\nsurvived. Just last week, three of the most promising US GaAs chip makers\\nagreed to merge.\\nFor Gazelle Microcircuits, Gigabit Logic and Triquint Semiconductor, the\\nmerger represents an opportunity to form an economically viable unit\\ncombining the best of three attempts to exploit GaAs chip technology.\\nCurrently, GaAs devices are used primarily in military applications, where\\ntheir high speed and tolerance of high temperatures is valuable, as well as\\nin high-frequency communications systems.\\nIn the far bigger market for computer chips, however, silicon reigns\\nsupreme. The worldwide market for GaAs chips was about Dollars 260m last\\nyear, up from Dollars 200m in 1989, according to Integrated Circuit\\nEngineering, a US market research firm.\\nNevertheless, Convex's adoption of GaAs has provided proponents with new\\nhope that the technology will become pervasive.\\nAlso spurring new interest is the need for high-speed peripheral chips to\\nkeep up with ever-faster silicon microprocessors that are used to power PCs\\nand workstations.\\nICE projects that the GaAs chip market will grow at an annual rate of 36 per\\ncent to reach Dollars 1.2bn by 1995. Today, military, aerospace and\\ntelecommunications applications account for almost 80 per cent of GaAs chip\\nsales, but by the middle of the decade computer applications will be close\\nto half of the GaAs chip market, the market researchers predict.\\nIf GaAs does become a commercial success then it will be in part due to the\\ndogged support provided by the US Defence Department. The Pentagon has been\\na major source of funding for GaAs semiconductor research and development\\nover the past few years.\\nThree years ago the Defence Advance Research Projects Agency (Darpa) began\\nfunding a research programme called Mimic (Microwave and Millimetre Wave\\nMonolithic Integrated Circuits) to spur development of GaAs devices for\\nmilitary uses.\\nIn a controversial move, Darpa last year provided Dollars 4m in research and\\ndevelopment funds to Gazelle Microcircuits, to stave off sale of the\\ncompany's technology to a foreign investor.\\nEstablished semiconductor companies, several of which participated in the\\nMimic programme, are now expanding their production of GaAs devices in\\nanticipation of a broader market. Motorola recently announced plans to build\\na Dollars 100m GaAs chip plant in Arizona, scheduled to begin production\\nnext year of chips for commercial and military applications.\\nThe prospects for GaAs microprocessors and memory chips remain uncertain and\\nthe chances are that silicon will remain the pervasive semiconductor\\nmaterial for these devices.\\nNone the less, Convex's decision to 'go GaAs' marks the entry of this\\ntechnology into the 'mainstream' of the chip market.

Imports of Japanese machine-tools have become so crucial that the\\nM1 Abrams Tank could not be built without them'.\\nThe proposed legislation would transfer control of CFIUS from the US\\nTreasury to the commerce department.

Estonia is attempting to exercise its own\\ncontrol through the use of a licensing bureau monitoring which, and at what\\nlevel, exports can leave its economic border.\\nOther republics and smaller-scale districts are following the same pattern,\\nsuch that one Bank of Estonia official described the USSR as being engulfed\\ninternally by a vast and complex amount of trade barriers: 'The USSR is\\nbecoming a country made up of many Albanias.'\\nEstonia's year-old Licence Department, backed by the muscle of its customs\\nofficials, is an attempt to eliminate the danger of chronic shortages of\\ncommodities, as well as an expression of its desire to mark out greater\\npolitical and economic autonomy from Moscow.\\nShortages of basic goods in Estonia have arisen, thanks to extreme\\ndifferences in relative prices between the different republics of the Soviet\\nUnion. Thus it has become a profitable trade to buy in bulk from one\\nrepublic at a relatively cheap price, and sell dear in a neighbouring\\nrepublic.\\nItems in greatest demand from Estonia include meat, sweets and other\\nfoodstuffs. In Latvia it is electronic equipment and vans, while in\\nLithuania it is refrigerators and television sets, according to Mr Rein\\nVoog, an official with the Bank of Estonia.\\n'A person can become rich very fast if he trades in the USSR. For example,\\nif you can buy meat in Estonia and take it to Leningrad you can make a lot\\nof money since meat in Leningrad is twice as expensive. This is why\\n(Estonia) must keep a certain degree of control over what leaves the\\ncountry,' said Mr Voog.\\nTo make sure no-one empties a market at the - by western and black-market\\nstandards - ridiculously low regulated prices, republics like Estonia have\\nissued their inhabitants with a purchasing card. A Latvian cannot, for\\nexample, buy meat at an Estonian market.\\nMr Voog admits that trade with the west is much easier than within the\\nSoviet Union, since the rules are clear and simple to follow. Estimpex,\\nwhich has lost its monopoly as the sole Estonian export organisation, still\\nfunctions.\\nThe Bank of Estonia official felt that for some companies it may be easier\\nto do business with Estimpex, which is known in some business circles in the\\nwest. It may also be easier to get an export licence through Estimpex. Since\\nGosplan has been undermined by the unstable economic situation in the USSR\\nand by inefficient price controls, Soviet republics such as Estonia have\\nestablished barter committees, state-run bodies, to carry out trade with\\nother republics. The export quotas of the Estonian barter committee are\\nregulated by the Licence Department.\\nMr Mati Jurgens, general-director of the Estonian Licence Department, says\\nit granted 1,700 export licences last year, and will double that in 1991.\\nMost of the licences are for furniture and building materials. About 60 per\\ncent went to Russia, the rest to the Ukraine, Latvia and Lithuania.\\nEach barter deal between the Estonian and other Soviet republic barter\\ncommittees is done on a case-by-case basis. There are no standard ratios or\\nvalues which the Estonian barter committee uses or agreements on which value\\na certain commodity will have. These factors are determined by forces of\\n'demand' and 'what is in great shortage', according to Mr Jurgens. If a\\ncompany's export papers are in order, getting an export licence should take\\nno longer than 15 days.\\n'A recent barter deal we approved with Russia involved an Estonian furniture\\ncompany, which purchased the steel to build the chairs. These chairs were\\nsold back to Russia for 70 roubles a piece,' explained Mr Jurgens.\\nOther examples of trade can involve cash roubles. An Estonian state,\\ncollective or co-operative farm may need to buy a tractor. According to Mr\\nJurgens, the seller of the tractor may ask as much as 30,000 roubles for\\nsuch a vehicle or two tons of meat in payment.\\nArguing over the price of the meat, they may agree on 10 roubles a kilo,\\nwhich would add up to 20,000 roubles' worth of meat. The remaining 10,000\\nroubles could be paid in cash.\\nMr Jurgens says there are still staffing problems in effectively controlling\\nEstonia's economic borders. A great deal of merchandise is getting out\\nwithout official permission; the Estonian-Latvian customs checkpoint at the\\nsmall town of Moisakula has one local policeman on patrol, who has\\npermission to use a revolver. One can cross the Estonian-Latvian border on\\nthe smaller roads without being stopped by any customs officials.\",\n",

Companies'\\nfinancial reports showed Ft93.2bn (Dollars 1.53bn) of accumulated foreign\\ninvestment at the end of 1990, compared with Ft29.3bn a year earlier.\\nOfficials expect another Dollars 1bn this year. In newspapers and\\nsugar-refining, foreign ownership has penetrated deep. Foreign media\\ncompanies now have dominant stakes in all Hungary's main national daily\\nnewspapers.\\nEven more dramatically, the number of joint ventures registered jumped from\\n900 at the end of 1989 to about 7,500 at the end of March, according to\\nCentral Statistical Office estimates. In addition, there are another 1,200\\ncompanies with foreign stakes.\\nOfficials and economists caution that many Hungarian businesses have set up\\njoint ventures simply to avoid tax or customs. A better - albeit indirect -\\nindication of a surge in interest is the breakneck pace of expansion of\\nwestern accountancy and law firms in the past 18 months.\\nEven so, consultants are finding it difficult to keep up with a quickening\\nrhythm of large acquisitions and new investments. The conclusions of deals\\nworth more than Dollars 40m are running at more than one a month so far this\\nyear. Moreover, many more transactions are in the offing as Hungary's\\nflagship First Privatisation Programme begins to take off.\\nInvestors are attracted particularly to Hungary because of the official\\nwelcome it gives to foreign capital. Western lawyers praise the foreign\\ninvestment and company acts for their western quality. Officials boast that\\nthe country has the most liberal investment regime in the world, citing the\\nright to set up in the service sector, acquire majority control without\\nspecial permission and fully repatriate profits. The company law mimics the\\nGerman. Better, the laws have improved with use in the two years they have\\nbeen in effect.\\nSo much for the principle. The practice has been frustrating, which makes\\nthe growth in foreign investment all the more impressive.\\nThe first problem, especially for deals involving real estate, is to find\\nsomeone with the authority to sell a property. Central and local authorities\\nand current occupiers and former owners make rival claims. A recent act\\ncompensating the last group should help but it leaves questions unanswered.\\nNor is approval from the State Property Agency, the central privatisation\\nauthority, easily obtained. It sometimes treats well-known international\\ncompanies 'shabbily', says one senior consultant. The agency promises a\\ndecision on whether to give the go-ahead to a serious proposal and then\\ndelays it, again and again, without explanation.\\nNegotiations themselves are an endurance test. Foreign buyers, state company\\nmanagers, SPA officials, the enterprise council representing the workforce,\\nand various accountants, valuators and legal counsels - all participate.\\nTurnout at these unwieldy meetings in smoke-filled rooms can easily reach 25\\nand the whole group goes through agreements word by word, says Mr Theodore\\nBoone, a lawyer at Baker & McKenzie.\\n'Hungarian managers are willing to bring up issues again which everybody\\nthought the book had been closed on.'\\nPrice can be a particular stumbling block because valuations vary wildly. 'A\\ncompany's past record is meaningless and everything around it is in flux,'\\nsays Mr Istvan Denes, managing director of the First Hungary Fund, an\\ninvestment fund. That can lead to big gaps between negotiating positions.\\nEven once the negotiations are over, the formalities of setting up a new\\njoint venture can hold things up. One of the tightest bottle-necks is the\\ncompany registration court whose 15 overworked judges can take three months\\nto handle an application.\\nPatience has been one of a potential investor's most valuable qualities. One\\ninvestment fund which has made it a particular virtue is John Govett's\\nHungarian Investment Company.\\n'HIC avoided the mistakes others did by diligence and investing a lot of\\ntime,' says Mr Adam Batthany, a prime ministerial adviser who doubles as a\\nboard member.\\nPatience is also needed more generally. It takes time to implement essential\\nlaws and rules; even longer for them to be worn in and for business culture\\nto change.\\nHungary is at least showing that the delay, while frustrating, is not fatal\\nfor investment in east Europe. Investment is taking off, and, says Mr Denes:\\n'It's getting easier by the day to get things done.'\",\n",

       " 'FT911-241': \"In his short ministerial life, Mr Michael Howard has played many parts, all\\nto mixed reviews. He piloted the Financial Services Bill through the Commons\\nwith great technical skill, but some think without much real feel for the\\ntask in hand. He was responsible for the poll tax legislation, about which\\nno more need be said; and he ran water privatisation, eventually to acclaim,\\nalthough at one point it looked as if his own career might not prosper as a\\nresult. Now, only eight years after becoming an MP, he is employment\\nsecretary as unemployment has crashed through the 2m barrier for the second\\ntime since the Tories took office in 1979.\\nIt is difficult to ruffle Mr Howard. He spent the years between 1970, when\\nhe failed for a second time to capture Liverpool Edge Hill, and 1983 when he\\nwon the safe-ish seat of Folkestone and Hythe, building up his reputation at\\nthe Bar. Once he has taken a brief, he does not easily yield; colleagues\\nreport that following Mrs Thatcher's demise, he remained one of the\\ncabinet's staunchest poll tax diehards.\\nBut people say Mr Howard is a briefcase carrier rather than a gut\\npolitician; that he is clever but lacks conviction or passion and that he\\nhas never had an original political thought in his life.\\nAt the first charge, one detects a modest stirring of Welsh blood - the son\\nof a dress-shop owner, he went to Llanelli Grammar School. 'I care deeply\\nand passionately about people, about issues and about the future of this\\ncountry,' he says.\\nBut to the second charge, he pleads guilty. 'I'm not sure you would find all\\nthat many practising politicians who can lay claim to original ideas. I\\nthink the art of politics is selecting the best of the ideas which\\noriginally were thought of by those not active in politics and making an\\nassessment whether they will work and achieve the result you wish to\\nachieve.' Before the interview, his office said he had written no political\\npamphlets; a fact which turns out not to be quite correct. He has in fact\\nco-authored two: one about the economy with his old friend Norman Lamont -\\nHoward was best man at the chancellor's wedding  - and the other,\\nimprobably, with Mr Julian Critchley advancing the case of the East African\\nAsians. He is due to publish one solo this week but it is just a rehash of\\nCentral Office nostrums.\\nIt is not hard to identify the badge on Mr Howard's philosophical cap. He\\npays homage to Iain Macleod; but above all, remains loyal to the founders of\\nThatcherism. 'I think we have established the tramlines along which we\\nintend to travel; they were established during the last 12 years,' he says.\\nOne aim of this interview is to find out whether the Thatcherite Mr Howard,\\nsurrounded by his paintings of the Battle of Blenheim, envisages any change\\nin employment policy in the light of the change at Number 10.\\nHis straight answer to this question is an uncompromising 'No. My agenda was\\nclearly set when I arrived here.'\\nAt the top was and is training. He has had the task of implementing the\\nblueprint to create 82 employer-led and dominated Training and Enterprise\\nCouncils across the land. 'I can speak for a very long time about this,' he\\nsays menacingly, having already spoken for several minutes about this 'very\\nexciting initiative'.\\nIt is indeed an important, if last-gasp attempt to smarten up Britain's\\nbedraggled training system, by handing the task to committees led on a\\npart-time basis by top local businessmen. He admits no doubt about the\\nsustainability of the approach, although he says he is frequently tested in\\nhis determination to stick to the principle that the businessmen involved\\nmust be of chief operating officer grade, rather than, say, personnel\\ndirectors. 'I remain of the view that it's right to stick to these demanding\\ncriteria,' he says.\\nHe is also not impressed with the other grumbles Tec chairman vent in\\nprivate. He thinks the Tecs are on target to deliver their guaranteed levels\\nof performance and that they should work through the current financial year\\nbefore he considers any further change to their freedom to shift funds from\\none area of work to another. The Tecs, says Mr Howard, already have more\\nfinancial and operating flexibility than any comparable body, something\\nwhich has made them richly inventive.\\nOn the future of trades union law, he is elusive. Having suggested early in\\nhis term of office that the Thatcher decade had completed the job, he now\\nappears to be wavering. 'We keep it under review and we must always look to\\nsee whether there's a need for further change in the law. Some recent\\ndevelopments, such as the episode of the NUM (the Scargill financial\\ncontroversy), have clearly indicated that the law needs attention, but we\\nhaven't reached any decisions yet on what the manifesto should say.' Among\\nthe issues he has in mind are the powers of union certification officers,\\nthe penalties for improper accounting and access by members to their unions'\\nfinancial affairs.\\nThe government's biggest problem in the employment area, however, continues\\nto be excessive wage pressure during a period of disinflation. He is\\nscornful of suggestions that some move towards a national economic\\nassessment or co-ordinated pay bargaining might have a role, sticking to the\\nThatcherite dictum: 'Locally devolved pay bargaining is likely to be the\\nmost effective.' The creation of a pay review body for the teachers was, he\\ninsists, a special case. 'I don't see that as a precursor for a profusion of\\nreview bodies in other areas.'\\nAssuming that Mr Howard continues to speak for his party on these matters,\\nthat suggests a potentially widening gap with a Labour party committed to a\\nminimum wage, upon which subject Mr Howard adopts his most practised silk's\\nscorn for a piece of bogus court-room evidence. He appears to harbour no\\nfear that the public mood is moving against him in this area. Nor, however,\\ndoes he have a convincing explanation as to why this attitude should not be\\napplied to wages councils, which set minimum wages for 2.5m workers in\\ncertain sectors. 'We see no permanent place for wages councils in our\\nsystem,' he says, but declines to say when the fox will be shot.\\nHe has been asked so often what it feels like to preside over another\\noutbreak of mass unemployment that the answers are cut and tucked into sound\\nbites; Britain still has below average unemployment in Europe etc. The\\ngovernment's job, he says, is to persist with the right, firm financial\\nframework and to take the consequences. That is what he means, he says, when\\nhe talks about the relentless, practical struggle over many years to apply\\nthe chosen political philosophy.\\nIt is only when we turn to Europe that there is a sign of the Majoresque\\nemollience. Mr Howard, like his former boss, enjoyed playing rough on\\nEurope, once accusing Ms Vasso Papandreou, the social affairs commissioner,\\nof bringing the Community into disrepute. On the day that Mrs Thatcher\\nresigned, officials in Mrs Papandreou's directorate were jubilant at the\\nthought that it might mean the end of Mr Howard.\\nToday, however, his tone is softer. He always used to say that one third of\\nthe social charter was totally unacceptable, a third possibly negotiable and\\na third, mainly that pertaining to health and safety, fine.\\nNow, he says, 'it looks as though a dozen out of 50 proposals are likely to\\nbe unacceptable', although it remains unclear which of these will be\\ndetermined by qualified majority and therefore leave Britain out-voted. 'We\\nhave done quite well so far, but there's no guarantee that we shall be able\\nto construct the necessary minority on all the proposals.'\\nThe more mellow atmosphere, he says, stems partly from a deal he struck with\\nMs Papandreou earlier this year, when she agreed that draft directives would\\nbe shown to member governments before publication and when she agreed to\\naccept additional help to improve the so-called 'impact statements'\\nevaluating the costs and consequences of proposed measures.\\nHe must, one imagines, be a formidable opponent in EC ministerial councils.\\nHe does his homework, enjoys detail and displays no self-doubt about\\nfundamentals. He has missed only one such council, which took place at the\\nheight of the leadership election, when he was doing his lonely best to\\nensure that Mrs Thatcher fought on.\\nNow she has gone, he will not say whether he thinks the party's chances of\\nelection victory have increased or diminished. Personal intimations of\\nmortality were delivered in the recent local council elections, when\\nFolkestone was lost to the Liberal Democrats.\\nIndeed, he makes little of the much discussed change of style at Number 10,\\npreferring instead to laud another of the new prime minister's qualities.\\n'It's determination that matters,' he says, 'battling.'\\nPersonal File\\n1941 Born south Wales.

The corporate escape from the\\ncredit squeeze, at least, has been well mapped: the steady stream of rights\\nissues, each greeted with unaccountable shock.\\nEfficient market theorists will argue that all these uncomfortable facts are\\ndiscounted in present price levels, and some cite the high dividend yields\\nof UK equities in support of this idea. But the international yield gap is\\nnormal, and the reactions to news which ought to have been expected suggests\\nthat the news is not discounted. On the contrary, it suggests that the\\nmarket is indulging in the wishful thinking always found at bull market\\nclimaxes - reading its picture of reality from its own price level. This is\\nas rational as raising morale by grinning at yourself in your shaving\\nmirror.\\nThis used to be quite a habit on Wall Street. The official US leading\\neconomic indicator formerly gave more weight to stock prices than it does\\nnow. The result was that when the market had a good run, the leading\\nindicator rose, and this was taken as confirmation that high stock prices\\nwere justified. The Street grew wiser after 1987, and so did the\\nstatisticians. Stock prices have been de-emphasised, and the market takes\\nless notice of the leading indicator.\\nIn other respects, the buoyancy of Wall Street is easier to justify than\\nthat of London. The consensus forecast is for a recovery, and the Fed is\\ndoing all it can to encourage one. Unfortunately, it remains a matter of jam\\ntomorrow; the current news continues to be, mainly, worse then expected.\\nConsumer spending, which is supposed to energise the recovery, remains\\ndepressed, despite the reported rise in confidence - not perhaps as\\nsurprising as it may look, since real disposable incomes in the US have\\ntaken their sharpest fall in 15 years.\\nInvestment is dropping, construction is still on its slow way down, and\\nexports are not dynamic. Only the weakness of imports makes the fall in\\noutput relatively shallow.\\nYet while expectations about the US economy are probably drifting into touch\\nwith reality, equity prices still make inadequate allowance for debt\\nproblems. Something like last Friday's crisis at First National, the\\nCalifornian life insurance company, should have been discounted.\\nIt has been obvious all along that in a depressed economy some companies\\nwhich issue junk bonds would be in trouble, and so would some companies that\\nheld the bonds. Junk bond yields show that the bond market has been\\nrational; but the 50-point fall in equities after the First National\\nannouncement suggests that reality stops there.\\nThe bond market, however, is being unrealistic in another way. Market\\ncomments, with some notable exceptions, are full of dire warnings about\\ninflation - warnings which may in fact prevent the Fed from easing any\\nfurther for some time. In fact, though, the only sign of inflation is in the\\nlevel of bond yields; and this owes more to German (and Japanese) inflation\\nexpectations than to those in the US. As long as the US Treasury has to\\ncompete with the Germans for long bond funds, it must compete on yields.\\nIn the real US world, producer prices have fallen for four of the last five\\nmonths, and the prices of inputs are still very soft; price expectations in\\nindustry are as weak as for the best part of two decades, wage rates follow\\ntheir usual sluggish American course, and productivity has been rising as\\ncompanies adjust to a soft market.\\nIt would take a much more vigorous recovery in demand than even the wildest\\noptimists are now predicting to stretch capacity to the point where margins\\ncan be pushed up aggressively. Current estimates are that US output could\\nrise at a 3-4 per cent rate for two years or more before any constraints\\nbegan to appear, but that is still in the unknown future. In such a time\\nframe US long bonds would surely look highly attractive; but the\\ndisappointing response to last week's auctions confirm that this is not yet\\nthe market view.\\nThe danger is that if the market does come to believe in the low-inflation\\nscenario, while bond yields are still held up by German problems, the yield\\ngap between bonds and equities can only be closed on the equity side. In\\nthis sense, the US equity market is potentially more vulnerable to good news\\nthan to bad, while the London market may well be more vulnerable to Wall\\nStreet than to reality.\\nFinally, a footnote about insider trading. Mr Alistair Alcock, a former\\ndirector of corporate finance at UBS Phillips & Drew, now at the University\\nof Buckingham, has sent me a couple of spirited articles he has written on\\nthe subject in the New Law Journal, which may not be on your normal reading\\nlist. He suggests that the insider trading law should be renamed the\\nProtection of Market-Makers Act, which gives you the tone. Try reading law\\nfor a change.\",\n",

It was a Sealink matter and British Rail could\\nnot help.\\nThe Sealink office in Victoria was of course firmly closed until at least\\n9am, by which time I would have missed several connections to the coast.\\nFortunately a bomb scare led to the evacuation of the international\\ninformation office and of some platforms, thus delaying departures.

I\\nwas told initially that the sailing had been cancelled, only to be\\ninterrupted by a further message that it was going ahead after all. That was\\nprecious little use to me, as it was far too late to reach Newhaven by any\\nconceivable method. On persisting with this mild objection, I was told to\\ntake the next train to Dover and that Sealink in Calais would provide\\ntransport to Dieppe.\\nAt Dover a Sealink hostess assured me that a message had been sent by radio\\nahead and that I would be met in Calais, intelligence repeated by the ship's\\npurser. But of course there was no-one at Calais, where all the baggage was\\nsent on to the railway station on the assumption that every non-car\\npassenger was going on to Paris.

Regulators have\\nsprung up in an ad hoc way, largely in response to political requirements,\\nas government has privatised industries and opened them up to competition.\\nThe Broadcasting Act 1990 created no fewer than six regulators to oversee\\nthe television industry, for instance.\\nAll the regulators, from the Office of Fair Trading, the utilities - gas\\n(Ofgas), telecommunications (Oftel), electricity (Offer), water (Ofwat) -\\naviation and television last week gathered for the first time to discuss\\ntheir role at a conference organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs.\\nHaving created a patchwork of regulatory bodies the government is starting\\nto consider how to give them a clearer purpose. Mr Peter Lilley, the trade\\nand industry secretary is leading the way by addressing how his department's\\nregulatory responsibilities should be made more coherent.\\nTo carry out a thoroughgoing review of the regulators' roles, particularly\\nwhere the privatised utilities are concerned, Mr Lilley's advisers will have\\nto tackle several questions:\\nWhat criteria should be used to assess whether a regulator is working\\nefficiently?\\nIn telecommunications, for instance, there have been complaints that it has\\ntaken Oftel far too long to determine the price and conditions under which\\nBT should make its network available to other operators. Comparisons with\\nregulation in other countries might be one way of judging British\\nregulators; more comparisons between the domestic regulators may be useful.\\nOne possibility suggested at the conference by Mr Centro Veljnowski, an IEA\\neconomist, was to set up a Whitehall audit unit to examine the costs and\\nbenefits of regulation and deregulation.\\nDo regulators need to be more activist to represent consumer interests?\\nOne of the regulators' main tasks is to protect consumers against utilities\\nwith monopoly power. Yet according to Mr Maurice Healey, director of the\\nNational Consumer Council, one of the main hindrances faced by regulators is\\nthat they can only react to plans proposed by the companies they regulate;\\nthey cannot suggest or stipulate what strategies the companies should\\nfollow. When BT proposed charging for its directory inquiries service, Oftel\\nwas not able to propose an alternative which consumers might have preferred.\\nIt could only comment upon BT's plans, says Mr Healey.\\nWhat scope is there for the regulators to promote competition?\\nSir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of Oftel, recognises his task is\\nconsiderably eased by new technology which is opening up areas of\\ncompetition in telecommunications. Because of this he can challenge BT with\\nthe prospect of entrants coming into the market with new technologies such\\nas mobile telephones or cable television.\\nAt the other end of the spectrum is the water industry, where there are no\\nprospects of technology-driven competition. This has led Mr Ian Byatt, the\\nregulator, to adopt so-called 'yardstick competition'. After comparing the\\nperformance and costs of different water companies, Mr Byatt will set prices\\nso that all companies have to match the standards set by the best in the\\nindustry.\\nAs other regulators run up against the realistic limits to competition in\\ntheir industries, they too may have to turn to 'yardstick competition' to\\nassess the efficiency of the companies they regulate.\\nWhat should be the responsibility of regulators in maintaining the social\\naspects of services provided by utilities?\\nTake telecommunications. As a nationalised company BT ran a national\\nnetwork, charging uniform prices, with revenues from more profitable\\nbusiness services offsetting loss-making domestic and rural services.\\nPromoting access to the telephone was part of a social policy sanctioned by\\ngovernments of both parties.\\nAs a privatised company, which faces growing competition, BT's services are\\nlikely to become more tailored to different customer groups, which will be\\ncharged different prices. There are concerns among Labour critics and trade\\nunions that less affluent, less profitable residential customers will be\\noverlooked in the new world of competition.\\nOftel and the government will come under pressure to lay out a clear\\nframework for the relationship between the commercial and social aspects of\\ntelecommunications markets and how these social obligations should be\\nfinanced. All the regulators will face this question of balancing social and\\ncommercial demands once competition intensifies.\\nShould the regulators be more open in the way they reach decisions?\\nAgreements with the companies they regulate are often concluded in secrecy.\\nAlthough all the regulators conduct extensive research into their\\nindustries, their conclusions are rarely published. Consumers cannot be sure\\nthat the regulator has not been quietly 'captured' by the company it\\nregulates. This is one of the dangers of regulation: gradually the\\nregulators 'go native' and start promoting the interests of the industry\\nrather than those of the consumers.\\nIn the US, regulation is much more open with hearings held at state and\\nfederal level to inquire into company plans. The risk there is that this\\nquasi-judicial system, in which companies give evidence to public hearings,\\nmakes the process adversarial and inflexible, says Mr Robert Osgood, a\\nspecialist in US regulation with legal firm Sullivan & Cromwell.\\n'There is another problem,' says Mr Osgood. 'Judges do not make a coherent\\nmanagement team.'\\nEven if such a judicial system is rejected there is a case for requiring\\ngreater openness from the regulators, perhaps modelled on select committee\\ninquiries. The regulators could hold bi-annual reviews of a company's\\nperformance which would take evidence from interested parties. The\\nbackground to important decisions such as significant changes to price caps\\nshould be made public.\\nMr Byatt at Ofwat is leading the way in consulting consumers. His office\\nrecently sent out 17m leaflets and held public meetings to seek consumer\\nviews on plans to change the way people pay for water services.\\nWho should regulators be accountable to and how should they be held\\naccountable?\\nRegulators should serve consumers, yet their masters are really government\\nministers. There is the additional danger that if the regulators evade the\\ninfluence of their companies, they may still be captured by politicians and\\nencouraged to bend to the demands of political expediency.\\nYet, as the system of regulation is likely to remain a feature of these\\nindustries for many years, it would make sense for the regulators to have a\\npower base independent of politicians. An alternative to appointment by\\nministers would be for subscribers to utility services to elect regulators\\non the basis of customer manifestos. Their power would then rest upon the\\nrelationship with the consumers they serve rather than with ministers.\\nShould the regulators be brought together under one umbrella to create\\ngreater coherence in their policies?\\nThe idea of a regulator-in-chief has been proposed by the Labour party. It\\nsounds plausible but is probably unnecessary. All the utility regulators\\nrely on the support of the OFT and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.\\nSir Bryan Carsberg says: 'The MMC's role as a backstop is very important to\\nunderline our powers.'\\nIn the gas industry, the MMC's inquiries in the industrial gas market were\\none spur for Ofgas to take more radical action than it had planned. One\\npossibility would be for the MMC to be more active as an independent auditor\\nof the regulators' performance.\\nIf the system has been successful with the privatised monopoly utilities,\\ncould it be extended to other areas of monopoly which remain in the public\\nsector?\\nAccording to Mr Healey, the most important priority for consumers is that\\nresponsibilities for owning a corporation and running a service should be\\nseparated from those of regulating it. He says: 'This really opens up\\nsignificant new territory for consumers because it makes it much clearer\\nwhere responsibility lies for running a service and setting the standards it\\nshould reach.'\\nA corporation with a monopoly in a service, which also sets the standards of\\nservice it has to meet, is unlikely to set standards as exacting as those\\nset by an independent regulator.\\nBritish Rail and the Department of Transport between them own, run and\\nregulate the railways. Consumers regard BR and the department as the chief\\nculprits responsible for poor quality, only to find that these two\\norganisations are also judge and jury of consumer complaints.\\nRather than wait for privatisation, why not establish Ofpost, for the Post\\nOffice, Oftube, for the London Underground or Ofrail for British Rail to\\ngive consumers a much clearer voice in decision making.\\nAfter all, this would be a return to the roots of regulation. The US\\nInterstate Commerce Commission, set up in 1887 as the first modern\\nregulatory agency, was modelled on the British Regulation of Railways Act of\\n1873, a regulatory scheme which the House of Commons soon after declared to\\nbe a failure.

Yet already there are signs of more streamlined\\ndecision-making and greater effort to frame policies for all EC members.\\nEventually, Brussels could have a much stronger hand in setting the 'green'\\nagenda. Controversially, it wants economic growth kept within bounds set by\\nwhat the environment can stand. As one example, the Commission would like a\\n'green tax' on all forms of non-renewable energy, to curb consumption.\\nAnother concern for companies is the Commission's plan to get them to report\\nannually on their effect on the environment. Under current thinking these\\n'environmental audits' for industry would mostly be voluntary. But they\\nwould be compulsory for larger companies in high 'eco-risk' sectors such as\\nchemicals and steel.\\nThe edge of EC environmental policy is at present blunted by:\\nthe normal requirement for unanimous approval of legislation by the EC\\nCouncil of Ministers, which tends to pull proposed standards down to the\\nlowest common denominator;\\nthe consequential tendency of the richer, 'northern' member states to press\\nahead unilaterally with stricter measures, which threaten to fragment the\\nsingle market;\\nthe failure of the Community as a whole to match rhetoric - and even formal\\npolicy - with action, classically instanced by member states' inability to\\nagree on a site for the European Environment Agency (EEA) which they voted\\nto set up a year ago.\\nMr Ripa di Meana's optimism will be borne out only if the Commission's new\\nenvironmental offensive progresses on all three of these fronts. Brussels\\nhas advertised this new determination by asking the member states to make\\nthe Treaty of Rome 'greener'. It has asked the inter-governmental conference\\non political union, which is revising the treaty, to change the rules so\\nthat environmental legislation is decided by qualified majority vote in the\\nCouncil - as most single market directives already are. This form of voting,\\ninstead of unanimity, requires a weighted majority, with the largest member\\nstates commanding the most votes.\\nThe Commission also wants the treaty to commit the EC to 'sustainable\\ngrowth', and to require environmental criteria to be integrated into other\\nCommunity policies. 'Never before has the Commission so clearly stated that\\nwe have to get equal status between the environment and growth - without\\nwhich growth itself is put at risk,' the green bespectacled environment\\ncommissioner enthuses.\\nIf endorsed by the inter-governmental conference, the proposed changes in\\nvoting requirements could raise standards significantly for legislation on\\nthe environment. In strict procedural terms, the unanimity rule is waived\\nonly when the Council decides unanimously it will vote by majority. 'I doubt\\nwhether Jonathan Swift at his best could have thought of that particular\\nformula,' snorts Mr Ken Collins, the Labour MEP who heads the influential\\nenvironment committee of the European Parliament.\\nOne Commission official says a change in voting rules will achieve a 'middle\\ncommon denominator', whereby environment provisions will be less quickly\\n'overtaken by time, events and technological developments'. He cited the\\nCommission's most glowing recent success: tight controls on car and lorry\\nemissions pushed through in the past 10 months. The parliament cajoled the\\nCommission into setting high standards and presenting them to Council as the\\n'harmonisation' of national regulations.\\nThis device exploits a grey area in the treaty as amended by the Single\\nEuropean Act. To use the device the Commission must prove that the\\nenvironmental measure it proposes is dealing with distortion of competition.\\nFour out of nine pieces of law examined by environment ministers in March\\npassed this test.\\nBut despite this advance, member state challenges to majority voting are\\nbecoming more frequent. The Commission's lawyers and the European Court of\\nJustice, moreover, monitor use of single market procedures for environmental\\nmeasures.\\nThe UK, for example, may well challenge the Commission's choice of majority\\nvoting for its proposals to standardise landfill operations for waste\\ndisposal. This case poses the dilemma acutely. The Commission feels certain\\nit could not win unanimity for a worthwhile law. Yet under current provision\\nfor majority voting, member states can ignore or go far beyond what is\\nagreed - creating the vision was designed to iron out.\\nBut the success of the vehicle emissions legislation which emerged under\\nthis procedure has yielded an interim, more richly-textured device, which\\nthe Commission has adopted as its new policy framework. Its goal is to\\nprevent the richer and greener EC members with stricter rules from\\ncontributing to a 'two-speed' Europe.\\nThe new framework aims to bridge an EC north-south divide, reining back\\nstates such as Germany and Netherlands, which have tougher standards, and to\\nlash forward countries such as Spain and Portugal which see less need for,\\nand can less easily affordsuch standards.\\nFrom now on, the Commission proposes a two-stage approach, modelled on the\\nvehicles emissions legislation: a first, compulsory package of laws,\\nfollowed by parallel, more stringent targets for the Community as a whole to\\naim at, but which individual member states can progress towards at their own\\nspeed. Fiscal incentives can be used to speed up the obligatory standards\\nand - only after these have been achieved EC-wide - to bring forward the\\ntougher norms.\\nThe intention is to end the chaotic proliferation of national incentives\\nwhich are threatening to undermine Brussels competition policy. Germany, for\\ninstance, has tried unilaterally to introduce vehicle emission standards\\nbeyond current EC policy through tax concessions on cars incorporating\\nadvanced catalytic converters. This would give such cars a price advantage,\\nand possibly constitute a barrier to imports of cars falling below these\\nstandards.\\nJust as important, if some member states were to follow their own green\\npath, the credibility of a common environmental policy would be shredded.\\nThis would undermine the Commission's ability to enforce viable measures on\\nthe EC as a whole.\\nBut the success of the automotive package, appears to be encouraging more\\naggressive thinking inside the Commission on how to achieve a balance of\\nincentives and disincentives for environmental ends.\\nNo one would accuse the ebullient Italian commissioner himself of thinking\\nsmall. His most ambitious project is undoubtedly for a mixed carbon and\\nenergy tax, in line with the EC's commitment last October to stabilise\\ncarbon dioxide emissions at their 1990 level by 2000.\\nWhen an embryonic plan for a straight 'CO tax' leaked two years ago it was\\nderided as lunatic. 'Then, I was just caressing it,' Mr Ripa di Meana\\nrecalls fondly, 'but now, we have won the right to discuss it.'\\nIn improbable alliance with Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the conservative\\nenergy commissioner from Portugal, Mr Ripa di Meana has developed a more\\nrounded proposal which the European Council is to report on by July. His own\\ndeadline for action is 'the other 1992' - next April's world climate\\nconference in Brazil, where a convention to combat global warming is\\nsupposed to be signed.\\nThe plan - which the Commission may still water down  - has been refined to\\nkeep the 12 together, and to emphasise competitive advantage.\\nThe core idea is that while a levy on fossil fuels according to their carbon\\ncontent would provide the greatest incentive to reduce emissions, it would\\nfall most heavily on coal, then oil, and last, gas, while not touching\\nnuclear energy. This would have an uneven effect across the EC, penalising,\\nsay, Spain, while rewarding France's extensive nuclear capacity.\\nBut a CO levy with a tax on non-renewable energy sources would even out the\\neffect, and could, the Commission believes, be introduced in a fiscally\\nneutral way by member states. The risk of the Community not acting jointly\\nis, once again, that Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands will go ahead with\\ntheir own, potentially market-distorting plans.\\nThe second emphasis is therefore to sell throughout the EC the merits of a\\nso-called 'no regrets strategy'. This means it should have clear\\nshorter-term benefits, competitive and environmental, to compensate for the\\nscientific uncertainty about the long-term effects of global warming.\\nMr Jos Delbeke, senior economist in the Commission's environment directive,\\nhas listed the benefits for the Centre for European Policy Studies\\nthink-tank. These included improved energy efficiency and security;\\ndiminished acid rain; more efficient transport policy, and relief of traffic\\ncongestion (which the single market will exacerbate); a catalyst to industry\\nto bring on line new capital goods and technology which uses less energy and\\nfewer raw materials. 'Japan has a comparative advantage in terms of\\nenergy-efficient equipment . . . and that is the market of the future,' Mr\\nDelbeke underlines; a fillip for greater harmonisation of fiscal policy; and\\ngreater macroeconomic convergence within the EC through common transport and\\nenergy policies.\\nNice balance would be needed, with offsets to ensure no loss of\\ncompetitiveness, Mr Delbeke stresses. 'It is not the idea to create\\ndeserts.'\\nBalance of a different sort - the 'you-scratch-my-back' variety  - has\\nprevented the EC from agreeing on a location for the European Environment\\nAgency. France wants a deal on the location of the EEA (Copenhagen and\\nMadrid are front-runners) to be made conditional on confirmation of\\nStrasbourg as the permanent home of the European Parliament.\\nMr Ripa di Meana's anger at France's de facto veto is matched only by his\\nscorn at her partners' refusal to dirty their hands in the dispute. Without\\nthe EEA, many other of his legislative ambitions will be stalled.\\nThe agency's core job will be to gather accurate statistics on the EC\\nenvironment. But it is also the key to a storehouse of measures, including:\\n'eco-labelling', a plan to institute an awards system for\\nenvironment-friendly products; and plans to introduce annual environmental\\naudits for industry. In the absence of these measures, national labels\\nfollowing different standards, and voluntary audits without guidelines\\nallowing comparison, are proliferating. The EEA is also vital for regular\\nupdating of existing directives, taking in technological advances member\\nstates might otherwise incorporate on their own.\\nMr Ripa di Meana says he will shortly be publishing a report on the EEA\\nfiasco deliberately intended to embarrass the member states. 'To have here\\nblackmail - and that is the word to be used  - is not acceptable,' he\\nvituperates. Harsh words, but the environment will not be seen to be on the\\nsame priority level as the 1992 programme until battles such as those over\\nthe siting of the EEA are won.\",\n",

And\\nunlike Orfeo and Alceste it was not revised and commercialised for Paris. In\\nthese pages 28 years ago, I wrote with rapture of a Royal Manchester College\\nproduction with Ryland Davies and Anne Howells among the student performers.\\nIf Paride has not captured the world's smaller stages, it may be because its\\ncast is five sopranos (Davies sang Paris an octave down), or because its\\nfive acts trace but a single action, Helen's surrender to Paris's wooing.\\nBut they trace it with such psychological subtleties  - the letters in\\nOvid's Heroides are the source of the libretto - and with such musical\\nbeauty that listeners remain spellbound. Paris lands in Sparta as a playboy,\\nbut falls deeply and truly in love.\\nLike Orfeo, Paride is at once an opera about and a demonstration of music's\\npower to touch the heart. The long, harp-accompanied aria that Paris sings\\nin Act 3, hypnotically beautiful, begins the conquest of Helen's scruples;\\nby Act 5, although Pallas Athene warns the lovers that dreadful, destructive\\nwar attends the surrender of reason and decency to emotion, and although\\nthey understand the warning, erotic force proves irresistible.

And the drama\\nstudents, produced by Moni Yakim, put the piece across with irresistible\\nverse and adresse. It was an athletic, very 'physical' production.

However, because of appeals by Mr\\nSeelig and Lord Spens against pre-trial rulings by Mr Justice Henry, and\\nappeals by three of those convicted in the first Guinness trial last year,\\nthat fixture was not met and further delays became inevitable.\\nMr Seelig and Lord Spens want to challenge in the House of Lords the Court\\nof Appeal's rejection of their appeal against Mr Justice Henry's ruling that\\nevidence they gave to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors\\ninvestigating Guinness can be used by the prosecution at the trial.\\nThe two men argue that the inspectors should have cautioned them against\\nself-incrimination and that the failure to caution makes it unfair for their\\nevidence to be used at the trial.\\nIt is an issue which is central to current concern about the powers given to\\nthose investigating fraud and the absence of a right to silence for those\\nsuspected of white-collar crimes.\\nA prerequisite for an appeal to the Lords is for the Appeal Court to certify\\nthat the case raises a question of law of general public importance, which\\nit will be asked to do this week. If that hurdle is surmounted the court\\nwill either give leave to appeal or tell Mr Seelig and Lord Spens they must\\nseek leave direct from the Law Lords.\\nUnless there are grounds for expedition, the time lapse between a Lords\\nappeal being lodged and heard is at least six months, which would suggest a\\nhearing date no earlier than November.\\nEven if expedited, an appeal lodged this month would be unlikely to come on\\nbefore October, because of the legal summer vacation in August and\\nSeptember. Given that the Law Lords' rulings are not normally handed down\\nuntil four to six weeks after a hearing, the trial date could well be pushed\\nback towards the end of the year.\\nMr Seelig and Lord Spens have waited more than three years to come before a\\njury, Mr Seelig having been arrested on October 15 1987 and Lord Spens on\\nMarch 10 1988.\\nThe prosecution of the seven men originally charged in the Guinness affair\\nwas transferred from Bow Street magistrates court to Southwark Crown Court\\nin November 1988, when it was expected that the trial would begin the\\nfollowing summer. By June 1989 the date had been moved to the following\\nJanuary. In October 1989 Mr Justice Henry decided on split trials, with Mr\\nErnest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman and chief executive, in both,\\nand with Mr Seelig, Lord Spens and Mr David Mayhew, senior corporate finance\\npartner of Cazenove & Co, the stockbrokers, alongside him in the dock in the\\nsecond trial.\\nWhen the first trial began in mid-February last year it was anticipated that\\nthe second would start the following October. When Guinness One ended in\\nlate August, however, Guinness Two was pushed back to January 14.\\nMr Saunders, who had been convicted on all but one of the charges he had\\nfaced in the first trial, was dropped from the second.\\nShortly before Christmas the second trial was split, hiving off Mr Mayhew to\\nbe tried in Guinness Three.\\nSince the beginning of this year legal arguments and appeals, coupled with\\nLord Spens' new lawyers' need for more time to prepare his defence, have\\nresulted in further postponements.\\nOriginally both defendants were represented by QCs, junior barristers and\\nsolicitors. In April 1989 Lord Spens announced that he could no longer\\nafford the mounting legal costs and was dropping his lawyers.\\nLast November he was granted legal aid, however, and will be defended at the\\ntrial by two junior barristers and solicitors.\\nLast year Mr Seelig also decided he could no longer afford legal\\nrepresentation and has since conducted his own defence.\\nThe two men are jointly charged under section 13 of the Prevention of Fraud\\n(Investments) Act with conspiring to induce Distillers shareholders to\\nexchange their holdings for shares in Guinness by the dishonest concealment\\nof material facts.\\nMr Seelig alone faces a similar charge under the same act, as well as two\\ncharges of false accounting.

As a result enforcement is patchy across the country. Some councils\\npursue any breach of the law while others turn a blind eye.\\nThe maximum penalty for Sunday trading is a Pounds 1,000 fine for any one\\nstore on any one Sunday. Local authorities can also seek High Court\\ninjunctions to prevent breaches of the Shops Act.\\nBecause some stores can make as much as Pounds 500,000 profit a year from\\nopening on Sundays, the Pounds 1,000 penalty has not proved an effective\\ndeterrent. Local authorities have turned increasingly to injunctions as the\\nbest way of banning Sunday trading over the past two years.\\nTwo weeks ago, however, the effectiveness of these injunctions was thrown\\ninto doubt by a High Court ruling that they should not be granted to local\\nauthorities unless they were prepared to give cross-undertakings to the\\ncourt that if they eventually lost their case they would compensate the\\nstores for any financial losses resulting from enforced Sunday closure.\\nCouncil lawyers say because of the potential financial risks involved in\\ngiving cross-undertakings this decision makes the Sunday trading laws\\nvirtually unenforceable.\\nLast week, for example, Texas Homecare, the DIY chain run by the Ladbroke\\nGroup, raised the pressure on six local authorities by stating that they\\ncould face a potential claim for damages in excess of Pounds 150,000 per\\nyear for each store where Texas had given cross-undertakings not to trade.\\nThe DIY chain asked the authorities to confirm that such an amount had been\\nreserved in their budgets.\\nB&Q will argue before the Law Lords that the Shops Act is incompatible with\\nArticle 30 of the Treaty of Rome, which prevents quantitative restrictions\\non imports between member states of the EC.\\nRetailers claim that the Sunday trading ban reduces their turnover and\\nresults in fewer orders for goods from suppliers in other member states,\\nthereby indirectly restricting the level of imports into the UK from those\\nstates.\\nThe issue has already been referred once to the European Court. In November\\n1989 the Court ruled the Shops Act would not be compatible with Article 30\\nunless the Sunday trading ban had an objective regarded as justified in EC\\nlaw and the effect on trade caused by the measure did not exceed that\\nnecessary to obtain that objective.\\nThis left the UK courts with considerable discretion which has only\\nsucceeded in increasing the confusion surrounding the Sunday trading laws.\\nBoth the Home Office and the British Retailers' Association (BRA) have\\nlaunched separate initiatives to try to establish common ground between the\\ntwo sides.\",\n",

Tokyo came third last year, a long way behind with Pounds 7.3bn.\\nJapanese stocks took the largest share of London's foreign equity turnover\\nin 1990, accounting for just over a quarter of the total. German shares were\\nalso heavily traded, accounting for about 23 per cent. Other European shares\\ncontributed most of the remainder.\\nThe Bank concludes that trading costs are low in London and that London's\\ntrading structure, with market makers taking positions between buyers and\\nsellers, provides superior liquidity for large wholesale trades.\\n'In the current liberal capital environment,' the Bank says, 'trading will\\ntend to move to where market conditions are favourable.'\",\n",

       " 'FT911-287': \"THE MOST CONVENIENT way to compare the economic size and wealth of countries\\nis to convert figures for gross national product into a common currency\\nusing market exchange rates. But the results can be misleading.\\nThe dangers are illustrated in this week's table, in which data on the gross\\nnational product or gross domestic product of each country have been\\nconverted into a common currency, the European currency unit (Ecu).\\nSome surprising things emerge. For example, Japanese GNP apparently\\ncontracted last year, to Ecu2,332.4bn from Ecu2,625.2bn in 1989, so reducing\\nJapan's share in the total output of the six largest industrialised\\ncountries to 22.5 per cent in 1990, from 24.2 per cent in 1989. Yet Japan's\\neconomic growth rate was the highest of the six countries, as the lower half\\nof the table shows.\\nThis apparent contradiction is explained by the yen's 21 per cent\\ndepreciation against the Ecu between 1989 and 1990. Large fluctuations in\\nexchange rates can give a misleading picture of changes in economic\\nfortunes.\\nWhat matters in comparing economic size is the relative purchasing power\\nthese figures represent: the quantity of goods that nominal GNP will buy in\\neach country.\\nThe OECD has calculated the levels of income needed in each national\\ncurrency to purchase an identical basket of goods and services at prevailing\\ndomestic prices. In 1990 a specific basket of goods costing dollars 100 to\\nbuy in the US would have cost Y19,800 in Japan and pounds 63.40 in the UK.\\nConverting each country's GNP into dollars using these purchasing power\\nparity (PPP) exchange rates provides a better guide to economic size, one\\nthat adjusts for fluctuations in exchange rates. The Japanese share in total\\nPPP-adjusted GNP did rise from 18.6 per cent in 1989 to 19.3 per cent in\\n1990, as one would expect.\\nThe adjustment for PPP produces a very different picture of relative\\neconomic size in 1990. Both the US and the UK have a higher share of the six\\ncountries' total output on the basis of the PPP measure than on the basis of\\ncurrent exchange rates, and vice versa for the other four.\\nThe graph shows levels of average GNP per head in 1990, converted into\\ndollars. At current exchange rates (on the vertical axis) Germany had the\\nhighest income per head, followed by Japan and the US. Using PPP exchange\\nrates, however, (on the horizontal axis) this order is reversed.\\nAt current exchange rates the relative size and income per head of the\\nGerman and Japanese economies is over-stated, relative to their purchasing\\npower equivalent - they both lie to the left of the 45 degree line.\\nThis means that prices overall are higher in Japan than in the US at current\\nexchange rates. Why then do US companies not sell more goods in Japan, until\\nthe price differences disappear? Perhaps transport costs, tariffs, or\\nrestrictive practices prevent US companies from doing so or, alternatively,\\nJapanese consumers prefer Japanese goods.\\nA better explanation is that prices are higher for non-tradable goods\\n(services such as domestic banking and insurance, taxis and hair cuts) in\\nthe continental European economies and Japan than in the US and UK, because\\nthese economies are relatively more efficient at producing tradable (largely\\nmanufactured) goods, and relatively less efficient at producing non-tradable\\ngoods. Thus, these four countries have higher real exchange rates (defined\\nas the relative price of non-tradable goods in terms of tradable goods).\\nThe prices of tradable goods are brought into rough equality by global\\ncompetition (ignoring the impact of trade barriers). Consequently these\\ncountries will have relatively high domestic prices for non-tradable goods\\nat market exchange rates. This will boost the value of their output at\\ncurrent exchange rates.\\nIf developing countries were to be included in the chart they would all lie\\nbelow the 45 degree line. This is because they are relatively less\\nproductive than developed countries at producing tradable goods than they\\nare at producing non-tradable goods. Thus dollars 1 buys far more services\\nin, say, Indonesia than in the US at current exchange rates.\\nIn recent weeks the FT has published the following tables: Balance of\\nPayments (April 15), Money and Finance (April 22), Production and Employment\\n(April 29) and Prices and Competitiveness (May 7).

       " 'FT911-288': \"MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, and his Soviet counterpart, Mr\\nAlexander Bessmertnykh, met over a 'working dinner' on the banks of the Nile\\nlast night in an against-the-odds attempt to 'kick start' the Middle East\\npeace process.\\nThe deepening dilemma facing the two men is how to persuade Israel to take\\neven the first tentative steps towards an historic compromise with the\\nArabs, based on key UN resolutions 242 and 338 requiring Israeli withdrawal\\nfrom territories occupied in the 1967 war.\\nAs they sat down for their repast the news from Israel could hardly have\\nbeen less promising. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli premier, again insisted\\nat the weekend that Israel would not withdraw from the occupied territories.\\nMr Baker would also not have been encouraged by the negative Israeli\\nreaction to his announcement on Saturday that Gulf states led by Saudi\\nArabia had agreed to send an observer to the proposed regional Middle East\\npeace conference. Mr Shamir's senior adviser dismissed the announcement as\\nunimportant.\\nHe said such countries had to go much further, ending hostile relations and\\nthe Arab economic boycott of Israel and taking a full part in any peace\\nnegotiations. 'We don't need observers as far as the Arab states are\\nconcerned, we need participants,' Mr Yossi Ben-Aharon, the director of the\\nprime ministry, said.\\nHowever, there was one small chink of light from Mr David Levy, the foreign\\nminister, who adopted a less strident tone, offering the Gulf Co-operation\\nCouncil (GCC) a cautious welcome and expressing hope that a peace process\\ncould be started.\\nMr Shamir also repeated a somewhat softened line on the key issue of the\\nsettlements by saying they would eventually be a subject for negotiation,\\nbut not at this stage.\\nThis fits with the position Mr Shamir has consistently adopted when\\nconfronting the demand that a peace conference be based on a 'land for\\npeace' formula.

       " 'FT911-308': \"Mexico's gross national product is less than 4 per cent of America's. Its\\nexports account for only one third of one per cent of US domestic\\nconsumption. So why does the prospect of a free trade agreement with Mexico\\nexcite so much more interest in Washington than the Uruguay Round trade\\ntalks - which affect US trade with the whole world, including economic\\npowers such as Japan and Germany?\\nThe answer lies partly in American indifference to the wider world. Mexico\\nhas a long border with the US; the hope that free trade will encourage it to\\nexport goods rather than people is taken seriously. Mention the General\\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), however, and you invite the blankest\\nof stares. The man on Main Street probably could not identify Geneva on a\\nmap, still less comprehend why a bunch of European bureaucrats should exert\\ninfluence over US trade policy. Never forget that international bodies count\\nfor little here: after 40 years, some congressmen still believe the World\\nBank is an aid agency based in New York. Gatt is obscurity squared.\\nThe deeper answer is that bilateral pacts, such as the planned agreement\\nwith Mexico, are more acceptable to the aggressive American psyche that the\\nabstract logic of multilateral trade liberalisation. Support for free trade\\nin the US has a short history. In the late 19th century when Britain was\\ntrumpeting the virtues of trade liberalisation (and gradually sinking below\\nthe waves as an economic power) the US was busy creating an industrial\\npowerhouse - behind high tariff walls. The US conversion came in the\\naftermath of the second world war, when Europe and Japan were weak and no\\nthreat to the US market.\\nWith the loss of economic hegemony, analysts are again questioning the\\nmerits of traditional free trade. US fears are encapsulated in a recent\\nessay* by Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former senior official at the commerce\\ndepartment who heads the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington\\nthink-tank. Mr Prestowitz invents the term 'Gattism' to describe 'a belief,\\nbordering on religious faith, in the power of ever more detailed trade rules\\nto solve major domestic and international trade problems'. He dismisses the\\nUruguay Round as a 'futile, legalistic crusade to homogenise different\\nnations'.\\nThe Gatt is based on two fundamental principles: 'national treatment' and\\n'most-favoured nation'. Under national treatment, members agree to treat\\nforeign companies exactly as they treat domestic companies. Under\\nmost-favoured nation, liberal rules agreed between any two Gatt signatories\\nmust be extended to all others. Mr Prestowitz (and many others) regard both\\nprinciples as unjust. This is because they do not require comparable rules\\nto be applied in all member countries. A restrictive country can impose all\\nkinds of barriers (provided it does not discriminate against foreign\\ncompanies) while its exporters piggy-back on the liberal laws agreed\\nelsewhere.\\n'Gattism' reflects a belief that unilateral trade disarmament is beneficial.\\n(Like Christians turning the other cheek, free market purists welcome\\ndumping and other infractions because they initially benefit the consumer.)\\nThe economic case for unilateralism, however, is weaker than often\\npretended. If you make the usual sweeping neo-classical assumptions - no\\neconomies of scale, no unemployment (because prices clear all markets) and\\nno uncertainty about the future - you can show that a small country should\\neschew protection.\\nBut even in this fairy tale world, neo-classical theory indicates that a\\nlarge country such as the US can benefit by imposing an 'optimal' tariff: at\\na certain level of protection, the gain from the improvement in its terms of\\ntrade more than offsets the loss of imports. Game theory suggests this\\nremains true even if other countries retaliate.\\nFree market purists are thus being dogmatic when they claim to have 'proved'\\nthat unilateral trade liberalisation is beneficial. It need not be even in\\ntheir idealised world. Nor is the empirical evidence compelling: the huge\\nsuccess of Japan and South Korea suggests that, for individual countries, a\\ncombination of export promotion and import restriction can be more\\nprofitable than unilateral trade disarmament. But it is not an option for\\nthe world as a whole. The question, therefore, is how to persuade countries\\nto pursue policies that may not always be in their own interests but which\\nbenefit everybody in the long run.\\nOne popular option is to lay greater stress on reciprocity - a principle\\nthat horrifies purists. 'I will open my markets if you will open yours' is\\nan offer that politicians and businessmen find difficult to reject. Unlike\\nstrict 'Gattism', it seems self-evidently fair. Yet it is most easily\\npursued through bilateral agreements in which like-minded countries can\\ndirectly trade concessions.\\nSeen through US eyes, mercantilist Japan is dominating Asia through a\\nnetwork of direct foreign investment links. European Community nations,\\nwhile outwardly in favour of multilateral trade liberalisation, are\\nconsolidating the advantages of preferential trading links through the\\nSingle Market programme. In the circumstances, who can blame the US for\\ntrying to forge its own regional trade bloc? Whatever happens to the Uruguay\\nRound, pacts with Canada and Mexico mark only the beginning of a more\\nassertive - and more selfish  - US trade policy.\\n* The Last Gasp of Gattism.

       " 'FT911-309': \"The two former City merchant bankers who are awaiting trial on charges\\narising out of the Guiness affair failed in the Court of Appeal (Criminal\\nDivision) to have the testimony they both gave to Department of Trade\\nappointed inspectors declared inadmissible at their forthcoming trial.\\nMr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell and\\nLord Spens, former director of corporate finance at Henry Ansbacher, may\\nhave a legitimate grievance that the law does not cover the questioning of\\nthose involved in inspectors' investigations under the Companies Act.\\nAnswers given by any person to inspectors are admissible in guidance in\\nsubsequent proceedings. But are the answers safeguarded in the way that\\npolice questioning is?\\nThe legal issue is simple enough. Are DTI inspectors within the meaning of\\nthe phrase in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, namely 'persons\\ncharged with the duty of investigating offences?' If they are, they would be\\nbound to caution witnesses who appeared before them. Even if the inspectors\\nwere investigating criminal offences, and there had been a breach of the\\ncode established under the 1984 Act, it would still have been in order for\\nthe trial judge to admit the evidence.\\nMr Justice Henry, who will be trying the second Guiness case and who\\nconducted the pre-trial hearing, had decided that fairness to the accused\\nwould not be threatened by allowing the evidence to be heard by the jury.\\n(Clearly, the prosecution attached great importance to the admissions made\\nby the two men to the inspectors.) The judge also rejected the claim that\\nimproper means had been used to compel the two men to incriminate\\nthemselves.\\nThe Court of Appeal had little difficulty in concluding that inspectors do\\nnot investigate offences of a criminal nature. They investigate events of a\\ncommercial or financial nature, in the course of which they are very likely\\nto uncover criminality on the part of one or more of the actors in the\\nevents under investigation.\\nThe inspectors' task is quintessentially inquisitorial; and the task\\npartakes of none of the aspects of the criminal process which is designed to\\nprotect the accused from any oppressive action by criminal investigator or\\nprosecutor. Inquisitions are by design held unremittingly to discover the\\ntruth. The English criminal trial, on the other hand, is a restricted method\\nto determine the guilt or innocence of an accused according to a high\\nstandard of proof. The trial process is the semblance of truth, or at least\\nmay only approximate to the truth.\\nIf the inspectors had nevertheless to caution a witness according to a\\nwell-recognised formula before asking any questions, or advise that he or\\nshe need not answer a question thought to incriminate the witness, it would\\nplace an absurd restriction on the ability of the inspectors to uncover all\\nthe relevant information.\\nIndeed, it may even be necessary for inspectors to withhold information from\\na witness until the questioning takes place, or to confront a witness with a\\nhighly material document for the first time during the questioning. Such\\ntactics would be regarded as highly irregular in a criminal trial.\\nInspectors normally try to be fair to witnesses, but in the final analysis\\ntheir duty is to extract the optimum information and report their findings.\\nMr Seelig and Lord Spens had asserted that there had been a conspiracy\\nbetween the inspectors, the DTI, the Serious Fraud Office and police\\nofficers that the inspectors would use their statutory powers for an\\nulterior purpose - namely, to build up a case for preferring criminal\\ncharges and not for the purpose of investigating company affairs.\\nTwo years ago such a danger was recognised by providing that where evidence\\nof a crime had been uncovered and referred to the prosecuting authority, the\\nminister could discontinue the inspectors' investigation. But those who have\\nto undergo the probing questions of inspectors will doubtless feel that the\\nexercise smacks of a preparation for criminal proceedings. Since criminal\\ncharges, not infrequently, do follow these inspectors' reports, such\\nreaction of those investigated is not unreasonable. It all seems unfair.\\nAny unfairness in the procedure is publicly tolerable, indeed necessary in\\nthe cause of finding the truth. What becomes less tolerable is the\\npublication of the inspectors' report - always held up pending any criminal\\nproceedings - because the individuals may be revealed for their commercial\\nirresponsibility, if not also for their criminality. Mr Robert Maxwell, the\\npublisher, smarted under the public condemnation of his behaviour as a\\ndirector over the affairs of Pergamon in the 1970s.\\nIt is a common feature of public inquiries generally that prospective\\nwitnesses are encouraged to come forward by promises that they will be given\\nimmunity in respect of their testimony. The attorney-general then declares\\nthat evidence before the inquiry will not be used in any subsequent criminal\\nproceedings.\\nSomething akin to that concession would be appropriate for investigations by\\nDTI inspectors. There is even a case for treating the investigation, with\\nits draconian powers, and the public report that follows as a substitute for\\na criminal trial, leaving it to stockholders or creditors to take\\nproceedings. But that would require an even more sophisticated approach to\\nthe dubious value of criminal justice, as opposed to a searching public\\ninquiry and civil action, in unravelling complex financial dealings.\",\n",

A trade surplus of only DM2.8bn, against a forecast of\\nabout DM3.5bn, was perhaps more worrying.\\nThe size of the problem can be gauged by the fact that the old West Germany\\nhad a current account surplus of DM12.2bn and a trade surplus of DM13.8bn in\\nMarch last year.\\nIn the first three months of this year the German current account deficit\\nwas DM8.9bn.

Some market participants feel there is no longer a separate role\\nfor IPMA, and the two trade associations should band together.\\nIn that case, issues such as the payment of lead management commissions\\ncould be discussed and resolved in the context of a more powerful body.\\nHowever, a potential merger between the two groups still seems to be a long\\nway off, and political interests may forestall any such development.\\nThere have been no discussions between the two bodies, even though many\\nmembers are in both, and might favour a streamlining.\\nThe proposal to rename the organisation ICMA also met some objections from\\nforeign members who felt that 'capital' might be misunderstood.\\nConsequently, the proposed name has been changed to the International\\nSecurities Market Association (ISMA), which was felt to be both sufficiently\\nbroad and accurate.\\n'The name (AIBD) no longer truly represents our members, a lot of whom have\\ntaken on several other functions (apart from dealing),' said Mr John\\nLangton, the AIBD's chief executive.\\nAs well as the handful of statute changes (including the name issue) due to\\nbe discussed at the meeting, a number of issues not on the official agenda\\nare likely to arise.\\nUnder an amendment to the directive proposed by the French, Eurobond\\ntransactions would have to be traded on regulated exchanges, and more\\nextensive price and volume reporting would be required.\\nAlthough all UK and some European firms report their trades to the AIBD, the\\nassociation would not be recognised as an exchange.\\nThe AIBD has been actively lobbying the EC to prevent such a development,\\nbut a stalemate appears to have been reached.\\nThe argument advanced by the French, that off-exchange trading means\\ninadequate investor protection, is strongly rejected by the AIBD, which, as\\na designated investment exchange under UK law, has been fighting to have its\\nstatues and rule book recognised.\\nThe AIBD is concerned that forcing all trades on to regulated exchanges will\\nlimit cross border trading and reduce liquidity.\\nAt the moment, something of an impasse appears to have been reached, with\\nthe UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, on one side, and the rest of\\nthe community, led by France, on the other.\\nHowever, the AIBD is optimistic that it will succeed in persuading the EC to\\naccept its statutes and rules as fair and equitable. The next step would be\\nto try to obtain regulatory status, Mr Langton said.\\nThe dispute over settlement procedures between the two European clearing\\nsystems, Euroclear and Cedel, is also likely to resurface, even though most\\nmarket participants say they have 'learnt to live with it'.\\nHopes have again been raised that agreement is near after an AIBD market\\npractices committee last week and a number of meetings between the three\\nparties (with the AIBD acting as a go-between).\\n'Euroclear has made a number of concessions and Cedel has respected those\\nand made some concessions too,' said Mr Langton, who added that there was\\n'an excellent chance' the problem would be resolved during this week's\\nmeeting.\\nLast year, the two clearing systems agreed to renegotiate their 10-year-old\\nbridge agreement, widening the issue at stake from an original contention\\nabout primary market settlement.\\nThe bridge between the clearers is the mechanism by which settlement\\ninformation is exchanged and is generally agreed to have become outdated.\\nA memorandum of understanding was signed last September.\\nIn October, Cedel put forward a proposal incorporating the need for multiple\\nexchange of files. Then in December, Euroclear put detailed proposals to\\nCedel which included a commitment to incorporate multiple exchange of files,\\nseen as an important concession by Euroclear.\\nOne issue which has never failed to spark complaints in the AIBD's 23-year\\nhistory is that of subscription rates.\\nUnder a proposed statute change, the flat fee, currently SFr6,000, would be\\nsubstituted for a set range of SFr7,500 to SFr10,000.\\nThe change is part of an attempt to improve the limitation of liability of\\nindividual members to claims against the association by limiting liability\\nto the annual subscription rate. However fees have frequently been a\\ncontentious issue, last leading to strong objections at the AIBD's Dallas\\nmeeting in 1988, when members complained they were subsidising the\\ndevelopment of Trax, the AIBD's screen-based reporting system.\\nBecause the AIBD has a strong UK membership, and is a self-regulatory body\\nunder UK law, continental European members have often complained they were\\nfinancing UK members' compliance with UK regulations.\\nNow that Trax is running, and the commercial operations of the AIBD are\\ngenerating funds, there may be resistance to any increase in fees. But for\\nmost leading firms, the costs involved are not significant.\\nThe issue of cost has also arisen in the context of the meeting's location\\nin Hong Kong this year.\\nSome dealers said it made the conference too time-consuming and too\\nexpensive.\\nIndeed, fears that a quorum might not be met have prompted proposals to\\nincrease the number of proxies.\\nHowever, the choice of a more expensive location - along with some more\\nimportant issues - have helped encourage firms to send more senior\\nexecutives, while in previous years, junior traders without the authority to\\nmake decisions were sometimes sent.\\nDiscussions about any move towards live screen prices are unlikely to\\nadvance.\\nAlthough this is felt to be a likely development in the longer term, the\\ndaily feeds which the AIBD provides seem to be considered satisfactory.\\nThe expense and the complexity of developing live screen prices in Eurobonds\\nare a deterrent, but such a shift also runs counter to some strong vested\\ninterests within the Eurobond market.\\nSome banks feel their ability to trade profitably would be compromised by\\ntoo much transparency.\",\n",

A day after\\nthis comes the latest information on inflation, as measured by the retail\\nprice index, which is expected to show that the annual rate of increase was\\njust over 6 per cent last month, from 8.2 per cent in March.\\nWhether the government will use the latest economic indicators as an\\nopportunity to make a further cut in base rates, now at 12 per cent, is\\nhotly contested.\\nThe Bank of England has already made its views known. Mr Robin\\nLeigh-Pemberton, the Bank governor, issued a thinly veiled warning last week\\nabout the dangers of cutting interest rates too quickly.\\nThe Bank is especially worried about underlying inflation - usually measured\\nby the RPI, less the effects of the poll tax and mortgage payments - which\\nis falling far less rapidly than the 'headline' rate.\\nAccording to this argument, the expected fall in the RPI is explained more\\nby technical factors, related to changes in the poll tax and interest rates,\\nthan by continued signs of demand being squeezed due to recessionary forces.\\nMr Leigh-Pemberton's statement was followed on Friday by the Bank lending to\\nthe money market at the prevailing base rate of 12 per cent for two weeks -\\na move which underlined the Bank's view that an imminent cut in rates would\\nbe inappropriate.\\nDespite the Bank's signals, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has the final\\nsay over monetary policy.\\nHe may feel that recessionary conditions are so tough that a  1/2 percentage\\npoint cut is justified - as part of the series of moves which have brought\\nbase rates down by 2 percentage points since February. Even more to the\\npoint, a cut in rates this week might help the Conservatives' chances of\\nwinning the general election, which could be held later this year.\\nIn the gilts market, the expectation is that Mr Lamont will cut rates soon.\\nThis sentiment helped to bring down yields at the short end of the market\\nover the past week, while those for long-dated gilts stayed virtually static\\nin lacklustre trading. In deference to the Bank's views, some believe Mr\\nLamont may make his announcement not on Friday, at the time of the RPI\\nfigures, but a few days later.\\nIf Bank officials are looking forward to this week's events with a certain\\ngrim foreboding, they are probably glad to have last week out of the way.\\nWhat had been an embarrassment to the Bank - a tranche of Pounds 800m-worth\\nof 9 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 2008 which had remained unsold for\\na month - was disposed of last Wednesday by the straightforward move of\\ncutting the price by 2 points.\\nThe manoeuvre led to sniping by some gilt specialists, who reckoned the\\nmarket-makers buying the securities gained too much of a bargain. Some\\neyebrows were raised because the Bank sold the stock at a price of 1/16 less\\nthan the market price. This discrepancy meant the Bank (and ultimately the\\ntaxpayer) gained from the transaction some Pounds 500,000 less than it would\\nhave done by selling at the market price.\\nHowever, to show that it was not put off by the episode, the Bank announced\\non Friday the sale of Pounds 200m-worth of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock\\n -one segment worth Pounds 100m carrying a maturity in 2001 and the rest due\\nin 2011.

The first\\n10-year government bond issue launched in February at a net yield of 12.64\\nper cent currently yields around 11.6 per cent, 10 basis points lower than\\nat the end of April. Analysts say lower yields stem from consistent overseas\\nbuying of Italian government paper. As in other higher-yielding markets such\\nas Spain, international buying has been based on the view that exchange rate\\nco-operation will force yields down to the level of the lowest-yielding\\nmarket in the European monetary system - Germany.\\n'A lot of international fund managers have accepted the idea of convergence\\nof European bond markets and are shopping around for bargains,' said one\\nLondon-based money manager.

Yesterday the Bank of Italy cut the\\ndiscount rate by one percentage point to 11.5 per cent, effective today.\\nOverseas buying has also been in evidence in the Eurobond market, where\\nborrowers such as Volkswagen, Barclays Bank and Credit Local de France, have\\ntapped international demand for Lira-denominated securities.\\nThe Euro-lira sector has been dominated by supranational borrowers such as\\nthe European Investment Bank and the World Bank.

From L760 against the\\nD-Mark at the beginning of 1990, the Italian currency now stands at around\\nL740.\\nHowever, dealers suggest this buoyant mood is fragile.

Any hint that Italy will not play a full role in the\\nnext stage could leave the government bond market exposed.\\nItaly's record of economic management has been criticised by the\\nInternational Monetary Fund and the Bundesbank.

The Treasury's record Dollars 37bn refunding on\\nTuesday, Wednesday and Thursday was hardly a runaway hit, but at least it\\nhad not spooked the bond market.\\nCalm seemed to prevail, despite the fact that Thursday's auction of 30-year\\nbonds attracted the smallest amount of bids since these securities were\\nfirst offered to the market on a regular basis in the 1970s. There was only\\nDollars 1.41 in bids for every dollar of the Dollars 11.75bn on offer.\\nAnd, while the average yield on the bonds sold was 8.21 per cent, in line\\nwith the market's expectations, there was a particularly large 'tail' - the\\ndifference between the average and highest bid  - of three basis points.\\nThat indicated dealers had widely different views of the value of the paper.\\nWhy did this news not send prices plunging immediately?\\nOne reason was that the market was anticipating good figures on inflation on\\nFriday, which it duly got: the producer price index rose only 0.2 per cent\\nin April, in line with expectations, in a further demonstration that the\\nrecession is putting the squeeze on inflation - though the bond market is\\nreluctant to accept this.\\nWhen this good news failed to attract fresh buying, however, the initial\\nrelief that the Treasury refunding was over turned to concern over the poor\\nreception received by the long bond, and prices began to tumble as dealers\\ntried to cut their inventory ahead of the weekend.\\nThe fall was intensified by a rumour that Californian insurance regulators,\\nwho on Friday clamped strong controls on a troubled insurer, First Capital\\nLife, were also demanding that it liquidate its junk and investment grade\\nbond portfolios. The upshot was that the new benchmark long bond closed the\\nweek at 97 7/8 , compared with 99 1/16 in the auction, while the yield rose\\nfrom 8.21 to 8.31.\\nBoth factors underline the market's concern about an oversupply of paper,\\nand this source of anxiety is not about to go away.

       " 'FT911-327': \"The man from Mercedes-Benz was astounded. A Pirelli manager had just offered\\na big tyre price reduction, something the German luxury car company had\\nneither asked for nor expected.\\nWith stories like this, it is no wonder some analysts say the tyre industry\\nalmost seems to have a death wish. Tyre producers have indulged in an orgy\\nof price-slashing. This has depressed their own selling prices even further\\nat a time of crisis in the industry and left the car companies crowing with\\ndelight.\\nAs tyremakers' profits have been decimated, due both to the motor industry's\\ntough cost-cutting efforts and their own aggressive competition, car\\nproducers have enjoyed price cuts of more than 20 per cent in the past year\\nor so. Adding to the tyre manufacturer's woes is the downturn in vehicle\\nsales in some European markets after the steep decline in the US. On new car\\nbusiness, says Mr Philip Wylie, motor analyst with Salomon Brothers in\\nLondon, 'they're all losing money on each tyre they make'.\\nIt is against this background that the latest, almost melodramatic, phase in\\nthe tussle between Italy's Pirelli and Continental of Germany has been\\nplayed out. Having been rebuffed in its first attempt at merger talks,\\nPirelli has succeeded in getting so-called 'round table' discussions under\\nway. And the man who so vigorously kept Pirelli at bay, Mr Horst Urban,\\nContinental's combative chief executive, has had to go.\\nHis departure was announced on Friday. Mr Urban had initially found it easy,\\nhelped by Morgan Grenfell, Continental's UK merchant bank adviser, to shoot\\ndown Pirelli's suggested merger terms. These would have basically involved\\nContinental paying a high price to take over Pirelli's tyre assets, but then\\nceding management control to Milan.\\nAt this stage, it is anyone's guess what will happen. Clearly, a merger\\nlooks far more likely, but it is still by no means a foregone conclusion.\\nNor is it entirely apparent that an amalgamation would produce significant\\nbenefits. Despite the big international takeovers in the tyre industry, such\\nas Japan's Bridgestone buying Firestone, and Michelin of France taking over\\nUniroyal-Goodrich, the aggressive pricing tactics of the big manufacturers\\ncontinue. Michelin, which has announced big job cuts, is seen as one of the\\ntop price-cutters.\\n'Competition has been stepped up another pace,' says Mr John Lawson, motor\\nanalyst with Nomura Research in London. 'The US market is going from bad to\\nworse, so the timing of the acquisitions everyone has made there look\\ndisastrous.' This obviously also includes Continental's own purchase of\\nGeneral Tire, now feeling the brunt of the US automotive slump.\\nPirelli's argument, which claims support from owners of more than 51 per\\ncent of Continental's shares - including 5 per cent in its own hands - is\\nthat the need for a merger is strengthened by the crisis. It has outlined\\nbig savings on production, marketing and development, as well as\\ngeographical advantages. Continental has admitted savings could be made, but\\ndisputes their size.\\nIn the end, Mr Urban's uncompromising tone proved too discordant for the\\nsupervisory board, which forced him out last week. His backing, even from\\nthe labour representatives, dissolved as it apparently became clear that the\\ncompany, and the industry, was in a worse situation than he had portrayed it\\n -especially in the viciously competitive US market. The feeling grew that\\ndiscussions with Pirelli should be pursued more constructively.\\nThe head of the non-executive supervisory board is Mr Ulrich Weiss, an\\nexecutive of Deutsche Bank, which also owns Morgan Grenfell. At a\\nsupervisory board meeting on the Friday before last he clashed with Mr Urban\\n -embittered sources in Continental talk of provocation. Mr Urban told Mr\\nWeiss after the meeting that he would resign if the board did not support\\nhim.\\nIt was that issue which the board met to discuss in Hanover on Thursday.\\nLining up with Mr Weiss was Mr Friedrich Schiefer, finance director and\\nchief executive-designate of the Allianz insurance group. Allianz holds 5\\nper cent of Continental's stock and is thought to be in the Pirelli camp.\\nThey, it is believed, were joined by Mr Gunther Sassmannshausen, former head\\nof the Preussag steel and metals group, Mr Ernst Pieper, chief executive of\\nPreussag, and Mr Klaus Piltz, chairman of the Veba energy group.\\nFaced with such weighty opposition, Mr Urban agreed to go. He is succeeded\\nby 60-year old Mr Wilhelm Winterstein, six years older and generally seen as\\nan interim choice. Mr Winterstein, previously purchasing director, has been\\nin the tyre business for 35 years and is thought more likely to enter into\\ntalks with Pirelli in a positive spirit.\\nIn Milan, the Italian company has built a wall of silence around its\\nheadquarters, saying nothing about where, when, or at what level these talks\\nwill take place. The company is avoiding triumphalism - otherwise obvious in\\nthe Italian press. But by stressing the need for 'the utmost\\nconfidentiality' in the discussions with Continental, it is acknowledging\\nthe delicate balance in Germany which has tipped the scales against Mr\\nUrban.\\nThus, the traditionally taciturn Pirelli is more circumspect than ever for\\nfear of triggering an adverse reaction in Germany which might embarrass its\\nsupporters there. The most sensitive issue is control of the combined tyres\\noperation, if a merger comes about.\\nDespite the strong trading links between Italy and Germany, Italian\\ncompanies are much less conspicuous in the German market than vice versa.\\nNot only does the short-termism often evident in Italy's business sector\\nclash with longer-range German practices, but Italian companies often face\\nsevere image problems in Germany. Their relative absence there reflects the\\ntendency to concentrate on southern Europe and the immense difficulties\\nwhich Italian businessmen often have in finding high-quality German\\nmanagers.\\nThus, apart from discussions on valuations and the structure of any merger,\\ncontrol is likely to be the trickiest issue that Pirelli must address.\\nNevertheless, its mood marks a sharp change from the bitter words of the\\nletter it issued to shareholders last February following the decision by\\nContinental's supervisory board not to pursue talks.\\nPirelli referred angrily to the inconsistency of the response shown towards\\nits plans by 'the heads of some major German institutions'. Although these\\nwere not named, the reference to Mr Weiss was unmistakeable. Pirelli claimed\\nthat he initially 'gave his agreement and support' to its tyre merger\\nproposal. Deutsche Bank, in turn, accused Pirelli of acting in a way that\\nwas 'misleading and thus likely to produce a false impression'.\\nThat atmosphere of tit-for-tat accusations has now evaporated. But when the\\nfinal chapter of this saga is written, the position of Germany's biggest\\nbank - and the issue of bank-industry links and boardroom representation in\\nGermany in general - will warrant special attention. So will the need for\\ncomprehensive, stringent takeover and share disclosure rules. For while the\\nPirelli-Continental affair will not make bid-sensitive German executives\\nquake in their boots, it has added a fascinating but more uncertain\\ndimension to Germany's mergers and acquisitions scene.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-328': \"THESE are difficult days for knowing what is happening in the British\\neconomy. But it is as good a time as any for evaluating the policy\\npriorities of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.\\nThe UK's usual statistical fog is being compounded by political noise as\\nboth leading parties appear determined to stay on election alert.\\nSo far, the most obvious symptom of this double malaise has been Mr Lamont's\\ntendency to accentuate the positive side of UK economic developments in his\\nrecent public statements.\\nBut with pressure rising among Tory backbenchers and in financial markets\\nfor another cut in British bank base rates from their current 12 per cent\\nlevel, there is a risk that the noise will direct economic policy and drive\\na wedge between the Bank of England and the Treasury.\\nSigns of incipient tension emerged last week. In a lecture at Exeter\\nUniversity, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England,\\nunderlined that the big fall in the retail prices index for April, which is\\nexpected to be published on Friday, should not be interpreted as a sign that\\nunderlying inflation is falling as sharply.\\nUsing veiled 'central bank speak', Mr Leigh Pemberton voiced his own and the\\nBank's belief that there should be a pause before base rates fall further,\\nfollowing their 2 percentage point drop from 14 per cent in the two months\\nbetween mid-February and mid-April. Last Friday, the Bank hammered home this\\nmessage in its money market operations by lending Pounds 965m at the base\\nrate level of 12 per cent for 14 days.\\nThroughout last week, however, financial markets chose to believe that\\ninterest rates would fall soon. The domestic money market betted heavily\\nthat Friday's big RPI drop would be the occasion for another 0.5 percentage\\npoint base rate cut. It was encouraged by the expectation that the annual\\nrate of RPI inflation in April will have fallen to about 6 per cent from 8.2\\nper cent in March as the impact of last year's poll tax bills drops out of\\nthe index. The Nationwide Anglia Building Society last week pre-empted such\\na move by cutting its mortgage rates by 0.7 per cent.\\nUntil recently, the Treasury and Bank appeared equally concerned about\\nunderlying inflation. It is probably still the case that Treasury officials\\nwould like some delay in the downward movement of interest rates to evaluate\\nthe economic effects of the cuts already made.\\nBut it is also possible to detect some difference in tone over monetary\\npolicy between the Bank and Treasury. The Treasury's reaction to last week's\\ndevelopments was muted. While the Bank was sticking its neck out against an\\ninterest rate cut, officials in Whitehall said the Treasury was 'agnostic'\\nover whether conditions would soon be right for a base rate move.\\nAll of which brings us back to Mr Lamont. He earned a reputation as an iron\\nchancellor in his early months in Number 11 Downing Street, as he carried\\nout the tough counter-inflationary policy that his predecessor, Mr John\\nMajor, summed up with the words: 'If it isn't hurting, it isn't working.'\\nBut Mr Lamont sang a different tune when in Washington last month for the\\nspring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Then the\\ntalk was of recovery 'round the corner' as he forecast that Britain would\\nreduce its inflation rate to near-European levels 'within a very short\\nperiod of time'.\\nThe chancellor's comments about economic recovery came at a time when\\nBritain's economic statistics are more than usually confusing. His\\nconfidence was based almost entirely on the latest quarterly survey of\\nindustrial trends from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).

In addition, the Central Statistical Office's (CSO)\\nlonger-leading cyclical indicator has turned sharply upwards since the\\nbeginning of the year.

This week's\\nindicators of economic activity, covering unemployment and industrial\\nproduction in April and March respectively, are unlikely to lift the gloom.\\nThe City scents that Mr Lamont, in seeing recovery through the statistical\\nfog, has chosen to put as positive a gloss as possible on economic\\ndevelopments for political reasons.\\nHis statement that recovery was round the corner came just days before the\\nMay 2 local government elections. If anything, the political pressure on the\\nchancellor to enhance the 'feel good' factor in the economy has increased\\nsince then. Quite apart from excitement over a possible general election,\\nthis Thursday sees another by-election test for the government in Monmouth -\\nwhich has been a safe Conservative seat.\\nFor these reasons, some City analysts have suggested that the base rate cut\\ncould come as early as Wednesday, when the Treasury should have its first\\ninsight into the April RPI and conveniently ahead of the Monmouth vote.\\nSuch a move is far from certain. It would be odd in view the Bank's firm\\naction on the money markets last week, but not unprecedented. It would also\\nhave to be judged against the economic data that has still to be released\\nthis week.\\nBut with election fever running strongly, the chancellor may find it\\ndifficult to square his political instincts with his job as custodian of the\\nnation's economic welfare.\\nOver the next few weeks, the electorate, financial markets and international\\ninvestors should be better able to judge whether Mr Lamont's first priority\\nis defeating inflation - as he has always professed - or whether he is more\\nanxious to secure victory for his party at the polls.\",\n",

       " 'FT911-335': \"MR Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, has repeatedly emphasised\\nhis commitment to free competition. However, the effectiveness of government\\npolicies intended to promote that objective is blunted by a number of\\nanomalies and shortcomings. Mr Lilley should use his promised statement on\\ncompetition issues, due in the next two months, to set out a more coherent\\napproach.\\nHis first priority should be to end the confusion created by his own\\nill-judged efforts to tighten scrutiny of UK acquisitions by foreign\\nstate-controlled bidders. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission has blocked\\nonly one of the five such deals referred to it - and then chiefly on grounds\\nof market share. As Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of the Office of\\nFair Trading put it last week, the discrepancy between Mr Lilley's stance\\nand the MMC's findings has thrown merger policy into disarray.\\nThe legality of Mr Lilley's position is also doubtful. The Rome Treaty\\nexplicitly prohibits discrimination between private and publicly-owned\\ncompanies, and state control is not recognised as a criterion by the\\nEuropean Community's merger policy, which takes precedence over national\\nregulations in controlling large deals. That is not to dismiss Mr Lilley's\\nunderlying anxiety that state-owned companies enjoy unfair financial\\nadvantages. But the sensible solution is to impose more transparency and\\ndiscipline on governments' dealings with nationalised industries, as EC\\ncompetition authorities are seeking to do.\\nNew legislation\\nBritain also needs to align itself with EC practice by giving the OFT powers\\nagainst cartels comparable to those enjoyed by Brussels. At present, it is\\ndifficult to curb UK restrictive trade practices unless they involve wider\\nCommunity interests. A White Paper proposing to correct this anomaly has\\ngathered dust for almost two years. Mr Lilley should commit himself to\\nintroducing legislation in the next Parliament.\\nThe biggest challenge, however, is to ensure the long-term consistency and\\nimpartiality of competition policy. That can be assured only if it is\\ninsulated from the unpredictable impact of short-run political influences.\\nAs an outspoken critic of government intervention, Mr Lilley should\\nrecognise the value of reforms to entrench that principle.\\nStrengthen OFT\\nThe first should be to strengthen the role of the OFT, at present mainly an\\nadviser to government. It should be given at least as much autonomy as\\nregulators of privatised utilities, which are formally not part of Whitehall\\nand report directly to Parliament. Like them, the OFT should also have the\\nauthority to refer cases to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.\\nThat power should, as a minimum, extend to mergers, where the wide\\ndiscretion at present enjoyed by the trade and industry secretary is hardly\\nconducive to firm and consistent policy. An independent OFT, immune from the\\nintense political lobbying which often accompanies large mergers, would be\\nfar better placed to decide objectively whether they should be referred.\\nClarity and efficiency would be further served by publishing the principles\\nand precedents employed by the MMC and by requiring its members to serve on\\na full-time basis.\\nThere may also be a case for entrusting the OFT with some surveillance over\\nthe regulators of privatised industries. Though the record of the regulators\\nto date is encouraging, their performance should be subject to independent\\nscrutiny. That is particularly true in industries such as\\ntelecommunications, where the government retains influence.\\nIn some respects, the power of national competition authorities is being\\neroded by Brussels. That makes it all the more important, however, that they\\npursue policies consistent with the EC approach and enforce them just as\\nvigorously. If the stiffer competition expected after 1992 is to produce its\\nfull benefits, it needs to be promoted within countries as well as between\\nthem.

       " 'FT911-336': \"IF THE US administration wants a greater emphasis by the World Bank on the\\nprivate sector, it has an odd way of showing it. The main manifestation so\\nfar has been its blocking last week of agreement to an increase in capital\\nfor the part of the World Bank group created specifically to help the\\nprivate sector: the International Finance Corporation.\\nThe IFC, which enjoyed growth of 20 per cent a year in the late 1980s,\\nclaims its expansion has been constrained this year by a lack of capital.\\nThe longer the delay, the more it will be hampered from doing its job in\\nfuture.\\nThe price the US wants for its assent to a capital increase is a more\\nexplicit focus by the World Bank group on the private sector. Once this\\nprice has been paid, the US has said that an increase of Dollars 750m should\\nbe considered, instead of the doubling of its Dollars 1.3bn in capital that\\nthe IFC is seeking.\\nThe most significant suggestion from the US - that the World Bank might lend\\ndirectly to the private sector - would require a change in the Bank's\\narticles of association and implies a profound shift in Bank strategy. Yet,\\nhowever frustrating they may find US tactics, many are prepared to concede\\nthat, up to a point, the US has a point, The Bank could work more closely\\nwith the IFC and should do more to help the private sector.\\nThe question is how. A distinction must be made between helping the private\\nsector and lending directly to it. The former does not entail the latter and\\nthe latter does not imply the former. It is equally important to remember\\nwhat direct lending to the private sector would signify. World Bank lending\\nto the private sector with government guarantees would reinforce government\\nmeddling in the private sector. But lending to the private sector without a\\nguarantee could threaten its credit rating.\\nMore risk\\nSome might argue that the World Bank should bear more risk, but the\\nimplications could be grave. Consider the IFC itself. It has been bolstered\\nby its successful equity investments in Third World stock markets and\\ncompanies, but the performance of its loan portfolio has been weak.\\nThe fundamental question is how far direct lending to the private sector\\nwould further the World Bank's development aims. One powerful case can be\\nmade for such lending. The current policy means that the World Bank can give\\nhelp to state-owned companies, but not to private companies that do the same\\njob. That constraint on the Bank acts as a disincentive to privatisation and\\nan obstacle to involvement with privatised companies.\\nImportant worries\\nYet there are also important worries. In many developing countries it is\\nsmall and medium-sized businesses that most need additional capital. Since\\nthe Bank is unable to assess the viability of such borrowers directly, it\\nhas to rely on intermediaries to do the job. In the past, these\\nintermediaries have often proved ineffective and sometimes corrupt.\\nThe value of lending by the World Bank to big private sector companies is\\nmore debatable still. If such a company is not creditworthy, the Bank should\\nnot lend to it; if it is creditworthy, loans from the Bank may merely keep\\nit out of private capital markets.\\nIt is also important to remember that the World Bank has a unique role in\\nfunding what will remain public functions in most developing countries:\\neducation, for example, or large scale irrigation, or roads. Any change in\\nWorld Bank policy must not threaten its ability to raise money and lend for\\nsuch purposes.\\nIn short, the Bank should listen to the US; it should improve its\\nunderstanding of the private sector; and it should consider direct lending\\nto it - but only on a limited basis and, if possible, through expansion of\\nthe activities of the IFC.\\nFor its part, the US should remember both that helping the private sector\\ndoes not entail lending directly to it and that development was not brought\\nabout by the private sector alone even within the US. Not least, it should\\nheed its own advice about the importance of the private sector and back a\\nsubstantial capital increase for the IFC.\",\n",

Morality, introspection, the rumbling, grumbling\\nlater playwright, these just peep through in Fredo Solter's interpretation,\\nwhich offers a surprise Ibsen; tongue in cheek, spring in step, spirit\\nsoaring.\\nSolter's is the lightest, brightest Ibsen staging I have seen.

Peer Gynt was written in\\nthe same year (1867) as Das Kapital and Solter plays the speculator's\\nventures as no less fantastical than the young man's dreams.\\nIt's a wild, lavish reading of the play - a cast of 25 treble up over 70\\nparts - yet one with diminishing returns, as each gimmick must work harder\\nwhile charming less hypnotically. Solter's vision would fit well into three\\nhours, yet the play runs for five. The Deutsches Theater, Max Reinhardt's\\nhome in the 1920s and the National Theatre of the former DDR, has a\\nrepertoire of 20 such classical productions and is not a theatre to offer\\ncompromises.\\nAs Peer, Daniel Morgenroth's triumph is to hold the stage despite the\\ndistractions of the zoo. With absolute conviction he grows from gangly youth\\nto autocrat. His voice - energetic staccato bursts modulating up to panic,\\ndown to reflection - speaks his continuing restlessness. Facial muscles are\\nnever still, knees knock together, hands wrestle with each other nervously.\\nAt once funny and vulnerable, he sweet-talks us into accepting the excess of\\nhis desires while acknowledging their theatricality.

A satisfied customer may tell up to eight others\\nof the good service he has received; a dissatisfied customer may tell up to\\n15 others. As a study published last year by Bain & Co, a management\\nconsultancy, noted, 'just avoiding this negative publicity has value' -\\nalthough quantifying it precisely is not possible.\\nFor the past six years Xerox, the office equipment manufacturer, has been\\ntrying to live up to its goal of making customer satisfaction its top\\nbusiness priority. It has found that the pursuit of this goal has led it to\\nreconsider its organisational structure and the way it remunerates its\\nemployees. The former is designed to place the whole capabilities of the\\ncompany - especially the service side of its business - closer to the\\ncustomer, while the latter aims to reinforce its rhetoric with real\\nfinancial advantages to employees.\\nIn Britain, Rank Xerox's way of getting closer to the customer has been to\\ndivide the country into five regions and bring together sales, service and\\nadministration.\\nIn the words of one recent management presentation to staff: '(The regions)\\nmust exercise local, pro-active, situational decision-making in order to be\\ntruly responsive to our customers.' It added that, in a business where the\\noffice equipment market is fast becoming a commodity market, 'customer\\nservice, support and application capabilities are now the key factors that\\ninfluence customer buying decisions'.\\nThose buying decisions, says Rob Walker, director of quality and management\\nsystems for Rank Xerox UK, can be worth a lot of money. Last year, customers\\ndiscontinued using 5,500 Xerox machines out of about 140,000 installed. If\\nRank Xerox had retained them all, the impact on its bottom line profit would\\nhave been an extra Dollars 8.5m in 1990, and, over three years, an extra\\nDollars 30m.\\n'If you then add in the opportunity cost the effect on the bottom line is\\nlarge,' says Walker. 'Not all of this is, however, controllable and\\nrecoverable. But we reckon that 30 per cent of it is. So the financial\\nimpact of dissatisfied customers is large.'\\nRank Xerox spends a lot of time trying to understand its customers,\\nespecially the dissatisfied ones. At present the company estimates that 7\\nper cent of its customer base is dissatisfied, and it is aiming to reduce\\nthat level of dissatisfaction to zero by 1993.\\nIt attempts to measure the level of customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction\\nthrough the responses it receives to two surveys conducted for it by an\\nindependent market researcher. The first is an annual survey, sent out to\\nmore than 130,000 customers. Last year, this survey had a 39 per cent return\\nrate. 'We take the dissatisfied responses and try to determine the root\\ncauses for the dissatisfaction,' says Walker.\\nThe second is a questionnaire sent out 90 days after a Xerox machine has\\nbeen purchased. (Before that the purchaser should have been called by a\\ncustomer care officer, and the salesperson responsible for the account\\nshould also have made a call to see that everything is functioning\\ncorrectly.) A 'vulnerable' report is completed which highlights dissatisfied\\ncustomers. These are acted upon by people in the regions, who meet, decide\\nan action plan, and agree with the customer what needs to be done to remedy\\nthe problem.\\nThe nature of the complaints is also analysed to see if there are any\\ngeneric problems with equipment or service delivery. Walker says the company\\nhas set up three cross-functional teams - comprising people from sales,\\nservice and administration, management and non-management from all levels\\nthroughout the organisation - to look at reliability, the order-to-install\\nlife-cycle, and response time. Their job is to improve the process.\\nSurveys, teams and analysis may be a rational way of understanding customer\\nsatisfaction/dissatisfaction and alerting management to problem areas, but\\nsenior management at Xerox soon discovered, in the words of Vernon Zelmer,\\nmanaging director of Rank Xerox, that 'it is hard to distinguish customer\\nsatisfaction from employee satisfaction. You can't have one without the\\nother.'\\n'Without happy and satisfied employees, who believe in what they do and who\\ncan see the managers 'walk as they talk', then the message will fall on\\nstony ground.'\\nFor the past two years, therefore, Rank Xerox has been working on employee\\nsatisfaction. This has involved work on role clarification (understanding\\nwhat the job is); employee involvement (being involved in the job\\nspecification); training; reward and recognition; and measurement.\\nOne of the more intriguing aspects of this has been the decision to tie a\\npercentage of all Rank Xerox's 4,000 UK employees' pay to the achievement of\\ncustomer satisfaction targets. The percentage of pay affected by this\\nincreases as employees become more senior in the company. Directors have 30\\nper cent of the value of their package riding on attainment of pre-set\\ngoals.\\n'We look for incremental improvements in customer satisfaction each year,'\\nsays Walker. 'Last year we set ourselves a target of growth of 4 percentage\\npoints for 1991. Xerox Europe has just told us they want it up by 6 points.'\\nHe claims that the company works hard at not allowing managers to make\\ntrade-offs between attaining customer satisfaction targets and ones relating\\nto purely functional and financial goals. 'If we deliver customer\\nsatisfaction all the other things will follow,' he says. 'This is probably\\nthe most difficult time since 1980/81 but we are still making investment in\\ncustomer satisfaction.'\\nZelmer is convinced that tying part of his employees' pay to the attainment\\nof service goals is the right way to go and is working. He says there has\\nbeen a positive correlation with the introduction of the new pay scheme and\\nthe company's market share in the UK.\\nAlthough he believes that customer satisfaction ought to have been Xerox's\\nprime aim from the moment it embarked on its quality drive - some 10 years\\nago - he is certain that to have tied remuneration to customer satisfaction\\ngoals would have been wrong. 'You can't do that until people have some\\ncontrol over what they do,' he says.\\nManagement evaluation has also changed. Zelmer subscribes to the view that\\n'experience shows that 90 per cent of the time it is management that's the\\nproblem, not the people.'\\nXerox, among other companies, has introduced a form of assessment where the\\nmanaged evaluate the managers. Known as the 'management practice survey',\\nemployees are asked to rate their manager. The results are anonymous and the\\nmanager sits down with his staff and goes through them.\\nYet this survey, and others, have shown up the gulf that still exists\\nbetween the aspirations of people who work at Rank Xerox and the reality of\\nworking there. As Walker notes, the four things that employees most value -\\nfairness and respect, reward and recognition, career opportunities, and pay\\n -are the things managers are least successful at delivering.\\n'We are trying to understand what the employees are saying to us and the\\nrole of management in motivating them,' he says. 'We want the role of\\nmanager to change from director to teacher and counsellor. But we still have\\na long way to go; you don't change behaviour overnight. Employees have to\\nsee senior managers behave in the appropriate way. It's difficult; it's the\\nnext big leap for us.'\\nThough Walker maintains that people are always capable of stepping outside\\nthe boundaries of their jobs/responsibil-ities they will do so only if they\\nare given support. 'They won't if you step on them the first time they do\\nit.'\\nAnd that is a real challenge for management. While senior managers accept,\\nintellectually, the new style and behaviour the company wants them to\\nexhibit, '60 per cent of them got to where they are under the old style,' he\\nsays.\\nPrevious articles were published on March 20, April 3 and April 12.

The girl is about to oblige, but her\\nsister grabs the frog, puts it in a jar, and closes the lid. 'Why did you do\\nthat?' asks the girl. 'Don't be silly,' says the sister, 'everyone knows a\\ntalking frog is worth more than a Perth entrepreneur'.\\nThe story illustrates the disdain with which Western Australia (WA) is\\nviewed among the eastern establishment following the collapse of\\nhigh-profile entrepreneurs like Mr Alan Bond and Mr Laurie Connell.\\nBut if early indications from an inquiry now sitting in Perth are\\nsubstantiated, it may turn out that self-respect is the least of WA's losses\\nfrom a period when critics claim the state abandoned many of the standards\\nwhich are essential for efficient government.\\nThe fallout will almost certainly lead to the ejection of the state Labor\\ngovernment after a decade in power, and will damage the re-election\\nprospects of Mr Bob Hawke's federal Labor government, which will suffer by\\nassociation.\\nFor much of the 1980s, Perth was the get-rich-quick capital of Australia, an\\neasy-money town where entrepreneurs like Mr Bond and Mr Robert Holmes a\\nCourt built business empires which shook boardrooms on three continents.\\nBut as the entrepreneurs succumbed to their mountainous debts, details\\nemerged of what is alleged to be a web of deals between government and local\\nbusinessmen, known collectively as 'WA Inc', which the Liberal opposition\\nclaims has cost taxpayers more than ADollars 1bn (Pounds 833m).\\n'WA Inc' is being investigated by a Royal Commission, due to report in\\nJanuary, which has already heard evidence of alleged undeclared donations to\\nLabor funds, illicit bank accounts used to finance propaganda, and envelopes\\nstuffed with money kept in ministers' offices. One witness said dealing with\\nLabor was like dealing with the Mafia.\\nLater, the inquiry will investigate deals involving government share\\ndealings, financial guarantees, and investments in companies and projects\\nassociated with well-known entrepreneurs.\\nThere are also allegations of illegal wire-tapping, improper land and\\nproperty dealings, and less than enthusiastic investigation of complaints by\\nthe state police. Two deals carried out by Liberal governments in the early\\n1980s will also be investigated.\\nThe key figure in the inquiry is Mr Brian Burke, WA's Labor premier from\\n1983 to 1988, when he became Australian ambassador to Ireland and the\\nVatican - a post from which he resigned last month after beginning his\\nevidence to the commission.\\nMr Burke denies any impropriety, and maintains that the commission will\\nclear his name. However, it is clear that his government had a close\\nrelationship with local businessmen.\\nUnder Mr Burke's leadership, the state took an active role in promoting\\nprojects through direct investment or share dealing by government-owned\\ninstitutions. Among the most costly were a ADollars 150m investment in\\nRothwells, Mr Connell's failed merchant bank, and losses of more than\\nADollars 300m on a series of deals relating to a proposed petrochemical\\ncomplex which was never built.\\nMr Burke, a charismatic former television journalist, was easily able to\\novercome opposition within his own party - as the first Labor premier for a\\ndecade he was seen as a messiah who had led the party out of the wilderness.\\nBut evidence is growing that the implementation of government policies owed\\nas much to the Australian phenomenon of 'mateship', or cronyism, as to\\npolitical dynamism.\\nWitnesses who have yet to give evidence before the inquiry allege several\\npublic service heads of department were removed or shifted to non-jobs to\\nmake way for 'mates' of Mr Burke who were politically sympathetic.\\n'It was not enough to be neutral; it was not enough to be an able public\\nservant. They wanted people who were on their side,' one displaced official\\nclaimed.\\nMr Barry MacKinnon, the state Liberal leader, says many of the appointees\\nwere 'compliant but not qualified', and blames much of the subsequent\\ndisaster on their inability to manage or give dispassionate advice.\\nOthers, like Mr Lyndon Rowe, director of the WA Confederation of Industry,\\nsay the 'mateship' syndrome is an inevitable consequence of life in a small\\ntown of around 1m people, even if it is the capital of a state the size of\\nwestern Europe.\\nBut it is a phenomenon from which Labor appears unwilling to distance\\nitself. Dr Ian Alexander, a state MP who left Labor partly because of 'WA\\nInc', says his efforts to persuade the party to condemn the Burke\\ngovernment's activities were repeatedly rebuffed.\\n'It is not the done thing to dump on your mates. That is part of the\\nAustralian tradition, and that is fine, but when people have been found to\\nhave acted in this way, somebody at the top needs to make clear that they\\ncannot do so with impunity,' he says.\\nDr Carmen Lawrence, the premier, refuses to condemn the Burke government, in\\nspite of the judgment of most political analysts that only that step can\\nsave her government from a huge defeat at the polls. Dr Lawrence concedes\\nthat the steady drip of disclosures from the commission is damaging Labor,\\nbut says it is 'important to be loyal to the tenets of the party'.\\nHer strategy seems to be to hang on to office in the hope that the\\ncommission will also damage the Liberal opposition, or that the voters' mood\\nwill have changed by polling day in two years' time. The danger is that\\nwhichever party wins the next election, the legitimacy of government in WA\\nmay have been damaged so deeply that it will take years to recover.\\nAs Mr Rowe puts it: 'The real cost of this whole exercise is not the money\\nthat has been lost, it is the added cynicism in the electorate about the\\npolitical process, which in Australia does not have a high reputation at the\\nbest of times'.\",\n",

He was referring to the general endorsement that\\nministers gave to the idea that the Community should soon start designing\\nspecific 'adjustment' plans for countries with chronic spending deficits\\nand/or double digit inflation. The EC's monetary committee has suggested\\nthree candidates - Italy, Greece and Portugal - for adjustment programmes.\\nMr Delors played down this innovation, noting that Greece had already\\nsubmitted itself to EC scrutiny in return for an EC balance of payments\\nloan, while Portugal and Ireland had called on Brussels for technical help\\nin setting budget policy.\\nBut introducing specific EC surveillance, well before the planned 1994 start\\nof the formal Emu transition phase, and extending it to all Twelve (as\\nFrance and Spain suggested), is sure to stir controversy. Mr Norman Lamont,\\nthe UK chancellor of the exchequer, said that, even after 1994, the\\nnecessary deficit-pruning and anti-inflation measures should be left to\\nindividual governments.\\nAs a form of monetary convergence, Mr Anders Rasmussen, the Danish finance\\nminister, suggested that from 1994 on, the fluctuations in the narrow EMS\\nband should be reduced from 2.25 to 1.5 per cent, and that in 1996 the wider\\n6 per cent band (within which sterling and the peseta currently gyrate)\\nshould disappear altogether.\\nBut for all such adjustment programmes, ministers generally recognised that\\na two- or multi-speed move to Emu was inevitable, a forecast that many of\\nthem and Mr Delors himself had earlier decried when it came from the lips of\\nMr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president.\\nIt was important to 'de-mystify' a two-speed Emu, Mr Delors said. The\\nlikelihood, he said, was that a majority of countries would assume the Ecu\\nas their single currency in the late 1990s, and that those countries staying\\noutside the Emu for a time would have their currencies linked to the Ecu, by\\nsomething similar to today's European Monetary System.\\nAfter Saturday's meeting, the Commission president refused to elaborate on\\nhis idea, hinting indeed that he might have been precipitate in raising it\\nso long before the expected wrap-up of Emu negotiations in the autumn.\\nSignalling clearly the likelihood that the UK would sign the Emu treaty\\ncould still cause the Major government problems with diehard anti-EC Tories\\nin the run-up to the UK general election that could also come this autumn.\\nMr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, echoed Mr Delors, saying:\\n'The treaty must be written so that it does not pre-empt a UK decision,\\nwhile at the same time allowing the Emu process to go ahead.' Mr Philippe\\nMaystadt, finance minister of Belgium, which like France wants fast movement\\nto Emu, described as the Delors idea as interesting.\\nBut Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, said he thought 'it\\ncould create more problems that it would solve'. He appeared to worry that\\nif the UK got its let-out clause, it would leave Spain more isolated in the\\nnegotiations. For economic reasons, Spain wants a relatively lengthy\\ntransition to Emu, but for political reasons does not want to be lumped with\\nthe likes of Greece in getting a special grace period.\\nOn the vexed issue of when the European Central Bank (ECB) should be set up,\\nMr Beregovoy sought to smooth over differences with Germany, with his\\nofficials talking only of an institution 'pre-figuring' the ECB being set up\\nin 1994. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, remained as firm as\\never in insisting that the ECB should only be established on the eve of a\\nsingle currency, and that calling any lesser institution the ECB would be\\ndangerously misleading.

By accentuating the cost squeeze on already uncompetitive east German\\ncompanies, the rise of 42 per cent in nominal wages in the first 10 months\\nof last year has contributed to mass unemployment and short-time working.\\nAfter extensive analysis and field work in east Germany, the study calls the\\neconomic collapse there 'one of the worst and sharpest depressions in\\nEuropean history'.\\nOpinion surveys carried out for the team in east Germany challenge the\\nconventional German wisdom on the reasons for east-west migration.

The four sets of chambers operating\\nfrom Cardiff are still expanding, but commercial solicitors tend to instruct\\nbarristers from specialised commercial chambers in London.\\nMr Robert Ellis, the partner in charge of accountants Touche Ross, points\\nout that professional services in Cardiff have increased continuously in\\nexpertise, and that clients who 10 years ago would have automatically gone\\nto London for advice now seek professional services in Cardiff.\\nThree common factors have emerged in the way the professions are coping with\\nthe present situation, and their plans for the 1990s. These are: to widen\\nthe markets they serve on a geographical basis; to deepen the level of\\nspecialties they offer; and to build up links with practices in other\\nEuropean Community and overseas countries.\\nThe first means, in effect, that firms are competing not only in the local\\nmarket but nationally. All the city's leading firms judge themselves by City\\nof London standards, and believe that, apart from projects involving large\\nnumbers of people or very specialised functions, they can compete in quality\\nand price.\\nProfessional fees in Cardiff are considerably lower than in London. The\\nhourly rates of the leading Cardiff solicitors are between one third and a\\nhalf of those of top City solicitors. The accountants have a price\\ndifferential of around a third less than London.\\nCardiff's lawyers and accountants are seeking to exploit this by combining\\nit with niche products and geographical access. Phillips & Buck, with 22\\npartners and 100 lawyers, has joined the Eversheds network to gain access to\\na national spread of offices.\\nMr David Vokes, managing partner, says this trend of increasing the\\ngeographical access (both nationally and through association with other\\nEuropean Community practices) fits in with the move to growing\\nspecialisation.\\n'We are in the business of solving clients' problems. While most of our\\nbusiness is based in South Wales, we are able to call on resources\\nelsewhere.

Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, for\\nexample, has built up a centre of excellence in work of this kind, and most\\nmajor projects are now referred to the Cardiff office by the group's other\\nUK practices.\\nThe second thrust of the strategy is to widen and deepen the levels of\\nspecialisation on offer. Huw Williams is a partner at Edwards Geldard, the\\nlaw firm, and is in charge of the its work for the Cardiff Bay Development\\nCorporation. He is a specialist in planning and environmental law.\\n'In the past, the legal work on the Bay would have gone straight to London,'\\nhe said. 'I think that what we have proved is a speedy response of\\nspecialised units which are based locally. Specialisation is the key to\\nsuccess, and that is what we have been concentrating on.'.\\nThe accountants have been at the forefront of the move to greater\\nspecialisation with the Cardiff majors providing a full range of financial,\\ncorporate and management consulting services. Hugh Thomas is the partner in\\ncharge at Price Waterhouse and a strong proponent of accountants becoming\\nmore involved with clients. 'I think we feel we are contributing more and as\\nWales becomes more entrepreneurial, there is a need for wider and wider\\nadvice,' he said.\\nOne example of this is the computer consulting business established by Ernst\\n& Young in Cardiff. Ieuan Griffiths, the senior manager in charge, believes\\nsuch services are now a crucial part of the overall package on offer: 'We\\ncan start from scratch and go straight through with the client in\\nimplementing strategy. Projects in some cases last a few months, in others\\nmore than two years.'\\nThe third part of the strategy and the most difficult to assess is the\\ndevelopment of links with professional practices in other Community\\ncountries. The accountants have had a head start with their existing\\ninternational links and the law firms have concentrated on developing\\nrelationships on non exclusive terms with continental law practices.\\nCardiff's professions have promoted awareness of the European single market\\nin a vigorous fashion. Today, for example, Edwards Geldard and Ernst & Young\\nhost a seminar on business in Europe - appropriate in a city where two of\\nthe main roads are named after Nantes and Stuttgart, Cardiff's twin cities.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-367': \"ON THE face of it, Cardiff seems to have plenty of hotels.\\nIf you emerge from Central station and look skywards slightly to the right,\\nyour eyes are met by the masthead of the Holiday Inn (182 rooms). It is\\nunusual to see a Holiday Inn in a British city centre: they tend to be built\\non the periphery of towns, close to motorways.\\nTwo hundred yards from the Holiday Inn, past the ice rink, is the\\nInternational Hotel (143 rooms), built by Brent Walker at a cost of Pounds\\n7.5m, and opened last September.\\nIf, instead of crossing St Mary's Street to the Holiday Inn in Mill lane,\\nyou turn left down St Mary's Street, you quickly come to the Royal Hotel (63\\nrooms). Continue past St David's Hall, and you come to the Angel Hotel (91\\nrooms). Situated between Cardiff Castle and the Arms Park rugby ground, the\\nAngel describes itself as the city's premier hotel.\\nClose by is the Park Hotel (119 rooms) and the Crest Hotel (157 rooms).\\nFarther out, near to the motorway, are the Post House (150 rooms) and the\\nMoat House (144 rooms).\\nAll of these are three- or four-star hotels. Most could be described as new\\n'business' or old 'town' hotels. They all charge between Pounds 50 and\\nPounds 80 a night.\\nIf a couple of places not mentioned are included, the total number of\\nbedrooms in quality hotels is around 1,000 to 1200. If one were to include\\ntwo-star hotels, Cardiff probably has some 6,000 rooms available.\\nHow much accommodation does a city need? Albeit a capital city, though one\\nwhich is not yet an established business-and-services centre, nor on the\\nwell-mapped circuit for cultural and heritage tourists? For the moment, the\\nanswer would seem to be: about what it has got.\\nThe occupancy rate of the Holiday Inn, for example, is 70 per cent, spread\\nthrough the week. It is full of business people during weekdays, while\\nweekends are a moveable feast. If there happens to be a rugby international\\nat Cardiff Arms park, the hotel is full to overflowing; if there is not, it\\ncan be empty.\\nAccording to Jack Nicholas, general manager of the Holiday Inn, a good\\nweekend trade was beginning to build in family tourists taking advantage of\\nheavily discounted room prices. But this was thwarted by the Gulf war and\\nthe recession. The past few months have seen a decline in weekend bookings.\\nMost of Cardiff's other quality hotels probably have occupancy rates similar\\nto that of the Holiday Inn, though the International Hotel has an occupancy\\nrate of 50 per cent, being a new hotel still building up business.\\nIf supply seems to be roughly in line with current demand, the situation\\ncould soon change, even though a Copthorne hotel is being built, for Cardiff\\nhas aspirations to become both an important business-and-services centre and\\na cultural tourist city, in the manner of York, Chester or even Glasgow.\\nFor most people, the transformation to a services or business city is linked\\nwith the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. When the barrage is built\\nacross the bay, Cardiff could become a maritime city with some 5m sq ft of\\nextra office space, many tourist and leisure facilities, and 30,000 new jobs\\nin buildings that will be put up on what is now largely derelict land. The\\ndevelopment corporation believes it will be 10 to 15 years before these\\ntargets are realised.\\nBefore then, other developments could ensure a greater demand for hotel\\nrooms. Opposite the International Hotel is the half-finished World Trade\\nCentre, being developed by Brent Walker. Technical problems have delayed its\\ncompletion. But with a city grant and a soft loan from the European\\nInvestment Bank, it should now be finished by the middle of next year.\\nIt will have exhibition space and conference facilities for 5,000 people.\\nBrent Walker also bought the ice rink in 1989. It has managed to change its\\nuse designation (though it is home to a successful ice-hockey team, which\\nwill continue to use it), and it can now be covered over and used, for\\nexample, for rock concerts. It seats 4,000. Despite Brent Walker's well\\npublicised financial problems of the past year, these projects are\\nproceeding, and will mean a greater demand for hotel space.\\nSo, too, may the efforts being made by Cardiff Marketing, a private company\\nsupported by local councils and the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. The\\nthought underlying Cardiff Marketing's efforts is that, if Glasgow can be\\npublicised into life, then why not Cardiff? It is, after all, a capital city\\nwith a rich cultural identity.\\nIt is estimated that 2m visitors went to Cardiff last year, but fewer than\\n100,000 went to tourist centres for information. The potential is therefore\\nconsiderable. The city may even get a five-star hotel.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-368': \"WHEN DE Courcey's restaurant burnt to the ground last month, a pall darker\\nthan the smoke from the fire hung over the business community. De Courcey's\\nhad, within a very short time, become one of the favourite places in which\\nto talk shop.\\nThe restaurant was the brain-child of Thilo and Pat Thielmann. He had been\\nmanager of the Holiday Inn, and the two of them decided to open a top-drawer\\nrestaurant, to which they eventually hoped to add a number of bedrooms, to\\ncreate the sort of restaurant with rooms that is so common in France.\\nThe wooden building had an unusual history. It had been brought over from\\nScandinavia in 1892, by a Nordic businessman who had settled in Cardiff and\\nwanted to live somewhere that reminded him of home. It was not only built of\\nwood, but the rooms were panelled. These the Thielmanns had carefully\\nrestored, by stripping off layers of paint.\\nWithin its short three-year life, the Thielmanns had turned the place, an\\nout-of-town restaurant deep in Cardiff's green belt, into one of the best\\nrestaurants in Wales. In three hours in the early hours of an April morning,\\nthe fire that consumed it left just the four brick chimney-stacks.\\nThe Thielmanns will no doubt create another restaurant. In the meantime\\ndiners, as well as business lunchers in Cardiff, are not starved for choice.\\nGood restaurants have grown with the city over the last decade, and if none\\nhas reached the very top level Cardiff is not unique in this respect. It is\\na curious fact that the Good Food Guide names 32 top-rated restaurants in\\nBritain, but only four in cities outside London - in Norwich, Plymouth\\nBradford and Bristol.\\nOne of the growing favourites in Cardiff is Trillium, which at first glance\\nlooks like a club library whose back part changes into a conservatory. Welsh\\nWater's main Cardiff office is around the corner, and many of its\\nexecutives, including the chairman, Mr John Elfed Jones, are to be seen\\nthere.\\nSlightly further out of the city centre is La Chaumiere, where Karen Duncan\\nand Rory Garvey took over some 18 months ago. The restaurant sits in the\\nshadow of Llandaff cathedral, but it gets rather more of its clientele from\\nthe nearby BBC headquarters than from ecclesisatical patronage.\\nAn innovative in-town restaurant is the Armless Dragon, where the\\nproprietor, David Richards, is also one of the two chefs. Although the basis\\nof the cuisine is European, there are touches of far-distant places and an\\nemphasis on pure foods. Diners include a good sprinkling of mandarins from\\nthe Welsh Office.\\nOne who has made a notable mark is Meirion Dally who, with his wife Ann, has\\ncreated a Welsh ambience at Blas ar Gymru, or A Taste of Wales. Wales has\\nnever had a particularly strong tradition of native dishes, but the Dallys\\nhave attempted to get as close to a Welsh cuisine as possible. They even\\noffer Welsh wine, produced just outside Cardiff.\\nThe waiters and waitresses at Blas ar Gymru are dressed in traditional Welsh\\noutfits, including the stove-pipe hats, and the piped music is Welsh. Dishes\\ninclude laver bread (a processed seaweed), cockles, Welsh cakes and Lady\\nLlanover duck, a traditional Welsh way of preparing the bird.\\nNot far away, and in direct competition, is Yr Ystafell Gymreig - The Welsh\\nRoom. Although the name is Welsh, the emphasis is more mainstream European\\nwith fillet steak Lloyd George offered as a touch of Wales. It also has\\nlaver bread on the menu.\\nAmong ethnic places, the Indian Ocean is a transplant from the people who\\ngave London the Red Fort; and a recent Chinese addition is the Orient\\nRendezvous, from which a dum sum could be dropped-kicked into the Arms Park,\\nthe great rugby ground, across the road. In a previous incarnation, this\\nrestaurant was called Spangherro's - after the famous French rugby forward.\\nNearby is the Noble House, where lovers of Chinese are frequently serenaded\\nby a harpist.\\nThe restaurant most characteristic of its homeland is Le Cassoulet, where\\nthe emphasis is on the dishes of the south of France. Cassoulet Toulousain\\nis always on the menu, and is a must for those who want to savour the\\nflavours of Provence.\\nTwo restaurants that have undergone something of a sea change are Gibsons\\nand Le Gourmet Enchante. Gibsons is the doyen of Cardiff dining places, its\\nchef-owner, Mrs Irene Caning, being virtually the first to bring innovative\\nFrench cuisine to the city. Le Gourmet Enchante was a more recent addition\\nin the same vein.\\nBoth have, in the past few months, taken on a new identity, with new menus\\nplacing them more firmly in the mainstream of French-style cooking. Gibsons\\nhas changed into Quayles, with Mrs Caning still in charge; while Le Gourmet\\nEnchante is now merely Le Gourmet, and describes itself as a brasserie. For\\nmusic-lovers, the Celebrity restaurant, in the St David's Hall, offers not\\njust reasonably-priced food but an attractive wine list at tempting prices.\\n --------------------------------------------------------\\n                 WHERE THEY ARE\\n --------------------------------------------------------\\nIN TOWN\\nLe Gourmet, Wesley Lane.

       " 'FT911-369': \"JUST BEFORE seven o'clock on the morning of April 8, a Jetstream 31, of Manx\\nAirways, took off from Cardiff-Wales airport, at Rhoose, 15 miles west of\\nthe capital, with a full payload of 16 passengers.\\nOne hundred minutes later, it touched down in Brussels, and a dream nurtured\\nfor years within the Welsh business community had become reality.\\nCapt Norman Brewitt, the airline's chief pilot, who was at the controls, had\\nhelped to introduce a service much needed in Cardiff - a direct link between\\nthe Welsh capital and the de facto, if not de jure, capital of the European\\nCommunity.\\nFour hours after the Brussels flight, another Manx aircraft, a JE 103, took\\noff for Dusseldorf. The two flights represented a double first: the first\\ntime Cardiff had been linked directly to these European cities, and the\\nfirst time Manx had run a continental service.\\nMr Terry Liddiard, managing director of Manx, says the company wants to\\ncreate a hub of services from Cardiff: 'There is enormous potential in South\\nWales, and we see it as a major centre for our services. We hope to bring in\\na twice-daily Paris flight later this year, and introduce another service to\\nManchester in the autumn.'\\nManx already operates services from Cardiff to the Isle of Man (its home\\nbase), Glasgow, the Channel Islands, Dublin and Belfast.\\nCardiff is not without international flights. Air France introduced a Paris\\nservice last year; and KLM, through one of its subsidiaries, has for some\\nyears operated one to Amsterdam. The latter, like the Brussels flights,\\nprovides a connecting point for passengers who want to fly on to other\\ndestinations without having to use Heathrow or Gatwick.\\nThere have been a number of attempts to bring intercontinental carriers into\\nthe Welsh capital, but this has proved a difficult business to generate.\\nAirlines providing flights to Toronto, Florida and the Caribbean have come\\nand gone, to the dismay of the airport's director, Mr Graham Greaves. These\\ncarriers have either been absorbed by bigger partners, or fallen into\\nfinancial difficulties.\\nBut Mr Greaves promises: 'We shall have Toronto, and Orlando in Florida, on\\nthe schedules this year - Toronto for the first time direct.' Nationair, the\\nCanadian airline, will serve Toronto with a Boeing 757, and the UK carrier\\nMonarch is also using a 757 on its North American operations.\\nThe core of Mr Greaves' strategy, though, is to develop Cardiff as a\\nbusiness centre for European destinations. 'We must try and generate more\\nscheduled flights,' he says. 'This is where our destiny lies.'\\nBusinessmen in South Wales have for years bemoaned the lack of direct links\\nwith European centres. Since Cardiff is one of the UK's three main centres\\nof government, they believe that Brussels, in particular, should be a big\\nearner, especially as civil servants need to travel there for meetings.\\nBut the South Wales business community is not large, and it will need to use\\nthe airport to the full if Manx's enterprise is to be justified.\\nThe omens are not overwhelmingly favourable, however, despite the cries for\\nsuch a link. Air France, for instance, has not had great success with its\\nParis service, launched last year, though this may have something to do with\\nthe less-than-convenient time-slot.\\nLike most regional airports in Britain, Cardiff, until last year one of the\\nfastest-growing, must therefore continue to rely heavily on its charter\\ntraffic for its immediate profitability.\\n'About 85 per cent of all our traffic is in the charter business,' says Mr\\nGreaves. 'That, inevitably, peaks between June and September; and so, to\\nutilise the airport's facilities more sensibly, we need to flatten that peak\\nby attracting out-of-season business.'\\nBut Cardiff, again like other regional airports, has been hit by the\\nrecession and the Gulf war. It also faces competition from Bristol which,\\nwith a catchment area of some 4m people, compared with Cardiff's 2.5m, is in\\na healthier position to attract holidaymakers bound for Spain, Greece and\\nthe ski slopes.\\nMr Greaves takes encouragement from what he detects as a change in holiday\\npatterns. 'Holidaymakers are looking to go further afield. They are looking\\nto the Caribbean and Florida, and this is where Cardiff has a distinct edge.\\nWe have the second-best weather conditions of any British airport.' He also\\nconsiders that Cardiff's runway, extended four years ago, provides\\nadvantages. 'Our 7,723ft runway can handle all the big giants - including\\nConcorde.'\\nTwo years ago, a British Airways jumbo flew non-stop from Cardiff to Seattle\\non America's west coast, with a full payload. And this winter some 30\\naircraft landed at Cardiff on diversions from Heathrow and Gatwick. In the\\nsummer, Concorde will take a party of Americans, holidaying in Europe, back\\nhome from Cardiff.\\nWhen British Airways opens its giant maintenance plant alongside the\\nairport, five jumbos a month will be flown into the airport, to be handled\\nin the hangar - a welcome boost in landing fees.\\nThose fees helped to increase profitability to a record Pounds 1.9m in\\n1989-90, the last year for which figures are available. The figures will\\ntumble for the year just ended, given the difficult time experienced by\\nairlines and airports around the world.\\nBut the Pounds 12m capital-spending programme is going ahead. Work begins\\nthis summer on a lounge for international passengers, and better Customs\\nfacilities will be provided. These should be ready by the end of next year.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-370': \"CARDIFF HAS such a vibrant and diverse media scene that it has often been\\ntermed 'media city' in its promotions.\\nDepending on where you are and how you set your aerial, it is possible to\\nreceive seven different television channels or variants of channels.\\nSimilarly, it is possible to tune in not only to Radio Wales but also to the\\nother five BBC stations, as well as a variety of commercial ones.\\nThe city has its own morning, evening and Sunday newspapers - the morning\\npaper, the Western Mail, styling itself 'the national newspaper of Wales'.\\nCardiff is also thought to have more independent television producers than\\nany city outside of London. If video companies and design concerns are\\nincluded, around 6,000 people are employed in the media industry, some 2,500\\nof them involved directly in broadcasting.\\nOne reason why there is such life in the media sector is the Welsh language.\\nAfter the failure to get an assembly for Wales, in the late 1970s, a\\npublic-service Welsh-speaking television station, S4C, was established in\\n1982-83. There was perceived to be a genuine need. Between a fifth and a\\nthird of people in Wales speak Welsh.\\nYet it was not just a question of language: there was a cultural identity to\\nbe catered for. At the same time, non-Welsh-speaking people were\\nincreasingly fed up with hours (often peak hours) of viewing time devoted to\\nprogrammes in a different language. The fourth channel was therefore a neat\\npolitical solution to a social and cultural problem.\\nThe fact that Cardiff is a national capital, rather than just the centre of\\na region, influences the printed media, too. John Humphries, editor of the\\nWestern Mail, pursues what he calls a twin-track policy:\\n'We have to compete with all the London-based newspapers - notice I call\\nthem London-based and not national newspapers - on international, political\\nand sports coverage. At the same time, we have to supply news about Wales,\\nin which there is great interest.'\\nNews of Wales is editionised. The Western Mail has nine editions, regional\\nand otherwise. Two pages of news about Wales are changed each night.\\nThe paper feels strongly about local issues. Recently it took David Hunt,\\nsecretary of state for Wales, to task for failing to push through parliament\\nthe private bill that would have allowed a barrage to be built across\\nCardiff Bay.\\nThe existence of S4C has meant that the two main television channels, BBC\\nWales and HTV, have prospered, because, in a sense, they had a captive\\nmarket. S4C has a budget of about Pounds 44m and runs about 25 hours of\\nWelsh-language programmes which go out on Channel 4. Until recently, those\\nwhich were not produced by the BBC were largely made by HTV. The main\\ncommercial channel had a five-year contract to make nine hours a week for\\nS4C.\\nSince the contract expired, however, S4C has turned more and more to the\\ngrowing band of independent producers.\\nLoss of revenue through the drop in demand from S4C has contributed to a\\nhuge dent in HTV's pre-tax profits, though other factors have included: a\\nnew exchequer levy imposed in January 1990, changes in the way programmes\\nare made, a poor advertising market, and competition from independent\\nproducers in areas other than Welsh-language programmes.\\nPre-tax profits for the year ended December 1990 were Pounds 5.3m on\\nturnover of Pounds 179m. A direct comparison is difficult, because of a\\nchange in the year end; but for the five months that ended December 1989\\nthey were Pounds 7.4m, and for the year ended July 1989, Pounds 14.5m.\\nHard times have also resulted in severe staff cuts. Some 700 people are now\\nemployed, compared with more than 1,000 two years ago\\nOne way to improve profits might be to make more programmes for the national\\nnetwork. But the domination of the network system by the big five commercial\\ncompanies (Central, Thames, London Weekend, Yorkshire and Granada), says\\nMansel Jones, head of press and public relations at HTV, makes it difficult\\nfor medium-sized commercial companies such as HTV to get a look in.\\nHTV faces further competition in that, by 1992, 25 per cent of output must\\nbe made by independent producers. But before then - this month, in fact - it\\nfaces a stiff challenge when its licence comes up for renewal. The new round\\nof franchises, which will be partly determined by sealed cash bids, is\\nconsidered unfair at HTV.\\nMr Jones has compared them to a 'blind crap shoot'. There is a feeling at\\nHTV that the expertise in making programmes for Wales should count for\\nsomething more than cash in an envelope when the bids are sorted.\\nBBC Wales, too, has been experiencing upheavals. As part of the Funding the\\nFuture exercise, which requires the BBC as a whole to save Pounds 75m by\\n1993, it is looking for savings of Pounds 2m and the loss or contracting out\\nof 300 jobs. It, too, has to commission 25 per cent of its output from\\nindependents by 1992.\\nWith this shake-up under way, Geraint Talfan Davies, controller of BBC\\nWales, sees the challenge of the future as making more English-speaking\\nprogrammes, not just for Wales but also for the national network. Recently,\\nBBC Wales announced that it would, for the first time, appoint a\\nnon-Welsh-speaker to a top programme post.\\nBBC Radio Wales already has a substantial number of its programmes\\nnetworked: last year, it had 306 hours broadcast on other BBC stations.\\nGaynor Shutte, the new editor of BBC Wales, wants to increase this\\nsubstantially, not just because it is lucrative, but because it keeps up\\nstandards.\\nIn contrast, BBC Television Wales networked only 20 hours last year, partly\\nbecause of its Welsh-language obligations. (BBC Scotland networked 160 hours\\nof its programmes). But Geraint Talfan Davies hopes the number of networked\\nhours will reach three figures in the next few years.\",\n",

The college, with 1,000\\nacademic staff, 28 schools and departments and more than 9,000 students, is\\nthe largest of the colleges that make up the University of Wales. Its size\\nand commercial contacts mean that it has a significant role in the life of\\nthe city.\\nIn 1989-1990, it won Pounds 2.1m worth of research contracts from British\\nindustry, and through other consultancy work generated an additional Pounds\\n1.8m. There have been several instances of high-technology companies being\\nspun off by the university college, as a result of projects in which it was\\ninvolved.\\nGeraint Jones is the head of UWCC's commercial services section, and at the\\nforefront of efforts to boost academic and industry links. 'There is often a\\ndifference in time scales, but our people are very appreciative of\\nindustry's ethos. It is important to retain a balance between pure research\\nand the subsequent use of new knowledge,' he said.\\nThe section acts as a focus for liaison with industry. Companies involved in\\nprojects include such big names as British Steel, Ferranti, Procter and\\nGamble, as well as local companies. Links are further fostered through\\nplacements of Cardiff graduates in 15 companies, to help with research under\\nthe Science and Engineering Research Council's Teaching Company scheme.\\nUWCC prides itself on a number of pace-setter departments which are\\ngenerally regarded as centres of academic excellence. These include city and\\nregional planning, aeronautical and mechanical engineering, maritime\\nstudies, nasal physiology, the semi-conductor and microelectronics centre,\\nand the automotive industry unit at the Cardiff Business School, which is\\npart of the university college.\\nThe mood at UWCC is one of cautious optimism, exemplified by a new Pounds\\n27m engineering faculty building scheduled to come on stream by 1993 and\\ncatering for 1,100 students. UWCC has also emerged as one of the UK's\\nleading centres of Japanese studies with a number of Japanese joint honours\\nschools introduced at undergraduate level where Japanese is combined with\\nsuch disciplines as law or business studies.\\nThe university college's most direct contact with business in Cardiff is\\nthrough the Cardiff Business School, the fourth largest in the UK with 1,000\\nstudents and 13 full-time professors. Its courses include both undergraduate\\nand postgraduate work and the school tailors courses for managers in local\\ncompanies. Recent research contracts include a study of the Principality's\\nlabour market, for Welsh Water.\\nProfessor Roger Mansfield, the school's head, sees a role for the school as\\na catalyst and enabler, to improve management skills in Wales. 'The rapid\\ndevelopment of short courses is based firstly on serving the growing needs\\nof the region, and secondly, developing courses in areas of particular\\nresearch strength.'\\nCardiff is particularly strong in the automative industry, Professors Dan\\nJones and Garel Rhys having built an international reputation. Consequently,\\nmost of the big motor manufacturers have used Cardiff for consulting work.\\nAt a non-academic level, training and education for jobs in Cardiff is\\nfocused on the new South Glamorgan Training and Education Council (TEC), set\\nup in February. It has a staff of 50 and a budget of Pounds 12m. Paul\\nSheldon, its chief executive, believes the tough decisions the TEC will be\\nmaking on training-provision in Cardiff are bound to be controversial:\\n'Our primary client is the employer. We have to ensure that we are training\\npeople for real jobs. That means we will have to look carefully at the\\nquality and scope of the training on offer at present.'\\nThe South Glamorgan TEC faces four priorities in determining the future of\\ntraining in the Welsh capital:\\nThe TEC has to carry out a quality audit of training provision, and decide\\nwhich courses and schemes to scrap. Mr Sheldon thinks the 60 organisations\\ncurrently involved in training is too many.\\nThere needs to be greater targeting in training in Cardiff. Traditionally,\\nthe take up-rates for adult training in Cardiff is around 90 per cent of\\nplaces filled, compared with 60 to 70 per cent nationally. However, if\\npeople in Cardiff are being trained for skills where there are no job\\nprospects, such courses will have to be scrapped, and emphasis placed on\\nmarket-led targetting.\\nThere are no models to forecast how the south-east Wales economy will\\nperform - an obstacle to detailed labour-market planning. Discussions are\\nbeing held with various groups in Cardiff to see if such a model can be\\ndeveloped.\\nThe public sector as an employer plays a crucial role in the Cardiff labour\\nmarket, with nearly 50 per cent of jobs in the city coming from the public\\nsector. Public sector orientated programmes need to be included in training\\nprovision.\",\n",

Our task is therefore to get the\\nworld to see that Cardiff is a fine place: that way, we shall attract\\ntourists, inward investment, more jobs and help enlarge the city's\\nprosperity.'\\nThat view is echoed by Miss Jarboe, who can take a dispassionate approach.\\n'Changing the image is what we must be about,' she says. 'People who come\\nare bowled over, and are only too happy to return.'\\nDiscounting the fact that it is Miss Jarboe's job to 'sell' the city, she\\ncan be more dispassionate than the locally-born solicitor who is her present\\nchairman, because she is an American and her links with the Welsh capital\\nwere minimal before her appointment.\\nNorma Jarboe, who is 44, was born in New Mexico, moved east to college in\\nDenver, and still farther east to work in New York on urban affairs and\\npublic-policy planning for Citibank. Soon after the Brixton riots in London,\\nin 1981, the bank was asked to second someone to London to work on\\ninner-city problem areas, and she was 'volunteered'. Although primarily\\nconcerned with Brixton after her arrival in London, her work subsequently\\nbranched into fellowship programmes and youth enterprise schemes; until\\n1986, when she herself branched out as a consultant in the field of public\\naffairs, community relations, sponsorship and communications.\\nThe thinking behind Cardiff's marketing programme has been heavily\\ninfluenced not only by the need to alter perceptions of the city, but also\\nby the success that Glasgow achieved with its Glasgow's Miles Better\\ncampaign.\\n'Glasgow have done what we want to do here,' Mr Seligman says. 'At one time\\nGlasgow was thought of as a rough, tough city. Today, it is seen as a city\\nof culture, a place of refinement, a place in which to do business, and a\\nplace where people will happily move to work.'\\nMr Seligman wants people around the world to think in the same way about\\nCardiff. 'Despite the general perception, we have already had a lot of\\nsuccess in attracting companies here. We have attracted Tesco with a\\nheadquarters operation, for instance, National Provident Institution and\\nRothschild. All of these have come in the past few years, so we knew that\\nwith a bit of a push we could use the campaign to broaden and develop the\\neconomic base of the city.'\\nMiss Jarboe says that the first step will be to bring the message to the\\ncity itself. Already posters with the Just Capital logo are beginning to\\nappear on sites around the city. 'We must give them a sense of involvement,\\na sense of pride,' she says.\\nMiss Jarboe speaks quickly. Thoughts and ideas pour out of her. 'Take the\\ntaxi drivers,' she says. 'They are often the first people a visiting\\nbusinessman meets. Get them to enthuse about the city, give them civic\\npride, and they will help influence the visitor. When we have laid the\\ngroundwork here in Cardiff, we'll take the programme wider: national within\\nthe UK first, then international. This has always been an international\\ncity, and we will capitalise on that.'\\nAll this is planned on Pounds 2m a year in each of the coming five years.\\nCan it be achieved? More important, can the Pounds 5m that has to come from\\nthe private sector be raised?\\nCardiff is not a city of big employers. Few have more than 1,000 people, and\\nfew of these have their headquarters in the city. Most of the potential\\ndonors that Mr Evans will have to approach probably have headquarters in the\\nsouth east of England, so their allegiance to the Welsh capital is not as\\ndeep as his own.\\nHis task as chairman of Cardiff Marketing is all about money and raising it;\\nbut in the present economic climate, charitable giving is being reduced.\\nThe Welsh politician, Ray Gunter, said in 1964, when Harold Wilson appointed\\nhim minister of labour, that he had been given the 'bed of nails'. The\\nparallel with Mr Evans' task is not inapposite.\",\n",

Rents at Principality House could possibly reach Pounds 18.\\nTraditionally, rents in Cardiff have tended to be lower than in many other\\nregional centres, although prime office rents almost doubled from Pounds 8\\nper square foot in 1987 to Pounds 15 in 1990. A survey last year, by Knight\\nFrank & Rutley, indicated that, while Cardiff was on a par with Newcastle\\nand Manchester, prime office rents in the Welsh capital were Pounds 3.20 per\\nsquare foot less than in Bristol, often used as a comparison with the city.\\nThe property market in Cardiff has held up in the economic downturn. A\\nreview by the property advisers Debenham Tewson showed that Cardiff had felt\\nthe effects of recession less than cities such as Bristol and Leeds. Mr Rhys\\nJames, a director of Debenham Tewson, said that rents in Cardiff had not\\nfallen during the past year.\\nMr Roger Thomas, regional director of Cooke & Arkwright, another of the\\ncity's leading surveyors and estate agents, reports similar findings.\\nActivity in the commercial property sector has slowed over the past year,\\nbut companies in the market for property are more selective, with continued\\ndemand for good quality new or refurbished accommodation.\\n'We need to get the picture in perspective. The so-called property recession\\ndoes not compare with that of 1973-74 and 1983-84,' he said. 'Despite\\nshort-term pressure, there are still underlying reasons for optimism about\\nthe long-term future in Cardiff.'\\nThe commercial property sector is predominantly office and retail space. By\\nthe end of 1990, the city had nearly 4.5m sq ft of office space. However,\\nmuch of it consists of 1950s and 1960s buildings, which will either have to\\nbe refurbished or pulled down in order to meet tenants' rising expectations.\\nNew developments since the late 1980s have provided opportunities for\\npioneering projects. 'Design is an important element of what contractors now\\nwant, and there is a strong architectural tradition here,' commented Mr\\nTerry Hoggett, of architects Hogget Lock-Necrews, the firm which designed\\nPrincipality House.\\nCardiff's property market falls into three distinct areas: the city centre;\\nthe M4 corridor with business parks at St MelIons and Llanishen on the\\noutskirts of the city, and several retail projects located at Culverhouse\\nCross; and the Bay area.\\nRents in the centre and on the M4 corridor area are roughly the same, but it\\nis the Bay which could have the most impact in the long term. The\\ndevelopment is to be phased over a 15-year period, but the office space\\nallocation in the Bay area is more than 5m sq ft, rather more than Cardiff's\\nstock of office space at present.\\nHowever, in the city as a whole there is still a shortage of large office\\nunits. It is a shortage that worries Mr Graham Moore, the property director\\nof the Welsh Development Agency:\\n'If we get a large company relocating and it needs 60,000 sq ft immediately,\\nwe have got a problem. There is a window of opportunity in Cardiff, and\\ndevelopers need to be encouraged to build speculative projects,' he said.\\nThe WDA is not actively involved in the Cardiff office market. It is\\nconcerned about the lack of institutional investment in speculative\\ndevelopment in the city, and the discrepancy in rents between the city and\\nother regional centres.\\nThe Knight Frank & Rutley report found that institutions were reluctant to\\ninvest in Welsh office space. 'The small investment market in south-east\\nWales has not yet reached the critical mass for a flourishing market to\\ndevelop,' it stated.\\nMr David Swallow joined the WDA last year in a newly-created post of private\\nfunding director. The agency hopes that its Welsh Property Venture\\nInitiative, which seeks generally to attract institutional money into Welsh\\nproperty, will have a spin-off effect on the Cardiff commercial sector.\\nMr Swallow has found no such reluctance among the institutions to invest\\nheavily in the retail sector. Demand for retail property has been hit by the\\ngeneral cutback in high street spending, although with a catchment area of\\n1.3m shoppers several new developments have come on stream. GRE Properties,\\nwhich has opened a specialist centre called the Capitol site, in the city\\ncentre, has introduced a number of turnover rental deals, a new feature of\\nretail rents in South Wales.\\nIndustrial property in Cardiff often tends to be overshadowed in what is\\nessentially a service city. The market was affected by the loss of land to\\nB1 use, and the relocation of business from parts of Cardiff Bay as that\\narea was prepared for redevelopment. Consequently it has been difficult to\\nidentify trends.\\nRents have been sustainable with modern units of under 3,000 sq ft reaching\\nbetween Pounds 5 and Pounds 5.50 per square foot. Medium-sized modern units\\nare fetching rents in excess of Pounds 4 per square foot, and larger units\\naround Pounds 3.

       " 'FT911-375': \"MANY PEOPLE describe Cardiff as a major international city waiting to\\nhappen. After the confusion in parliament last month, the wait may be longer\\nthan they expect.\\nProgress of a locally-sponsored private bill, to allow a barrage to be built\\nacross Cardiff Bay, creating a non-tidal 500-acre freshwater lake, was\\nblocked at an all-night sitting. A group of Labour MPs who oppose the\\nscheme, largely on environmental grounds, made long speeches and raised\\npersistent objections.\\nThe government says it will now take over legislation to build the barrage,\\nand bring in its own bill.\\nWithout the barrage, which would cost about Pounds 80m, says the Cardiff Bay\\nDevelopment Corporation, Cardiff will not be transformed into an important\\nmaritime city. The corporation is charged with renovating and developing\\n2,700 acres of partly-derelict land around the bay.\\nAlthough Cardiff is the national capital of Wales, it has yet to find a new\\nwider role. The bay was once the port for heavy industry; but coal and steel\\nwent into decline, and Cardiff, though still active as a port, conducts a\\nfraction of the business it once did. Much of the land around the bay has\\nfallen into disrepair. The bay itself is heavily tidal, with an average drop\\nof 40ft between tides. At low water, it is a vista of unattractive mud\\nflats.\\nUnder Mr Peter Walker, the former secretary of state for Wales, new\\nindustries, both British and foreign, were attracted to the valleys and\\nother parts of Wales. Cardiff has begun to develop as a financial centre,\\nservicing these industries. It has also become something of a media city,\\nwith many independent film-production companies. But in terms of rebirth, it\\ntrails behind such cities as Bristol and Cambridge.\\nSome relocation towns along the M4 have developed London-type congestion and\\nhigh costs. Cardiff, towards the end of the motorway, has not yet been\\noverrun by developers. Land and property were cheap, and skilled labour was\\navailable. What was needed was for the land around the bay to be revived. In\\n1987, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was set up.\\nLike many of the other 10 urban development corporations, its purpose was to\\nrejuvenate and restore degraded acres, using government money as a catalyst.\\nIts plans were drawn on a grand scale: 1,000 acres of the 2,700 under its\\ncontrol were considered to be immediately developable. Within 10 years, some\\n4m sq ft of office space and 5m sq ft of industrial factories could be\\nbuilt. There would be 6,000 houses, a quarter of them social accommodation\\nfor low-income families.\\nThere were plans for an opera house and a maritime museum, as well as\\nmarinas, hotels and shops; 30,000 jobs would be created directly, and up to\\n15,000 indirectly; around Pounds 2bn of private capital would be invested.\\nCardiff would become a grand maritime city, a bit like Sydney.\\nThe barrage across the bay was the basis for the grand design - but without\\nit, the mudflats were so unattractive that investors and developers would\\nnot take the bay seriously.\\nThree years were put into preparing the private bill. It had to be a\\nparliamentary private bill, because the barrage was a single engineering\\nproject, albeit a large one. But now the bill has now been thrown out.\\nWhat has gone wrong? In a sense, nothing. David Hunt, the present secretary\\nof state for Wales, has said that the government will pick up the\\nparliamentary bill, and make it part of its official business. With the\\ngovernment whips behind it, it will almost certainly get through at some\\npoint. But the question is: when?\\nMuch of the opposition to the barrage was on environmental grounds. The\\nmudflats are the habitat of wading birds, and the bay has been designated a\\nsite of special scientific interest. There were fears that a barrage would\\ncause flooding. The rivers Taff and Ely flow into the bay, and there has\\nbeen flooding in the past. A fresh-water lake would create problems with\\nalgae, said opponents of the barrage, so that the lake would be muddy brown\\nrather than blue, making swimming impossible. Finally, it was suggested, the\\nground water-table would be affected by a lake, so that houses would\\nsuddenly start to develop fungus in their basements.\\nThe seven Labour MPs, who conducted the filibuster that blocked the private\\nbill, emphasised these issues. But many of the criticisms have been met by\\nthe development corporation. It says research has shown that algae can be\\ndealt with, as can the threat of flooding. The corporation proposes to spend\\nPounds 5m to provide an alternative wildlife sanctuary for the wading birds\\na few miles way. The ground-water problem is being investigated.\\nAt bottom, the opposition of the Labour MPs ' not all of them Cardiff\\nmembers ' seemed to centre not simply on environmental problems, but on a\\nmix of arguments. These ranged from the view that Cardiff should become a\\nbetter capital of Wales rather than an international city, to the belief\\nthat too many developers would make too much money out of lakeside projects.\\nThe development board may have done itself a disservice by inadvertently\\ncreating the impression that, without the barrage, there would be no\\ndevelopment around the bay.\\nThis is not the case. So far, the private sector has invested about Pounds\\n250m in the bay area. The board itself has been active in infrastructural\\ndevelopment. It is spending money on a peripheral distributor road, which\\nloops off to the east and west of the M4.\\nPerhaps because of the time taken over the bill, it has studied other\\ndevelopment areas and learned from their mistakes. Unlike Southampton, say,\\nwhere the waterfront developments are divided from the old town centre,\\nCardiff Bay projects will be locked on to the established city centre.\\nThe development corporation is anxious to begin; the South Glamorgan county\\ncouncil supports the barrage; Cardiff city council wants it.\\nThe danger is that the government bill, which Mr Hunt now promises, may be a\\nlong time coming. A general election might bring a change of government, and\\nthe Labour party does not have the same commitment to the barrage.\\nFurther delay could mean the difference between a piecemeal waterside\\ndevelopment and a dream enterprise. Opinion polls in the local press suggest\\nthat most of the people favour the dream.\",\n",

       " 'FT911-3329': \"THERE ARE few opportunities more welcome than that of using someone else's\\nmoney, free of charge. When that opportunity is offered by the government to\\nexporters of goods in the form of a cash refund of tax not yet paid, it\\nwould be madness not to take advantage of it.\\nThis has certainly been the view of a number of manufacturing exporters in\\nrelation to value added tax and, until Customs and Excise attacked the\\nPhilips Electrical group of companies, at the end of 1989 the arrangement\\napparently worked well. How that arrangement operated demonstrates a\\nprinciple of VAT which is of interest and potential benefit not just to\\nexporters but to all those who pay it.\\nThe events which followed the attack on Philips reveal a good deal of\\nconfusion in VAT administration policy.\\nThe scheme, if it can be called that, used the simple mechanics of VAT to\\nachieve a substantial cash flow benefit. It works as follows.\\nA business which sells goods only to UK customers taxes those sales at the\\nstandard rate of 17.5 per cent. It will pay over to Customs the tax which it\\ncharges and collects (output tax) having first deducted from that payment\\nthe amount of VAT paid to its own suppliers on purchases and other\\nexpenditure (input tax). A business which sells goods for export does not\\ncharge VAT on those sales (they are zero-rated) but can claim back its input\\ntax from Customs, ie, it receives repayments of VAT. The difference between\\nthe two types of businesses is that an export business can claim its VAT\\nrepayments monthly, whereas most businesses which have to charge their\\ncustomers VAT make returns and account for VAT quarterly.\\nA company which makes both standard-rated sales in the UK and zero-rated\\nexport sales would normally make three-monthly VAT returns. Such a company\\ncan improve substantially its cash flow by selling the exports through a\\nsubsidiary, registered separately for VAT. The export company then makes\\nmonthly returns, claiming repayments of the tax charged to it on sales by\\nthe parent, up to 10 weeks before that same tax has to be paid by the parent\\nto Customs and Excise.\\nThe advantage to be gained by doing this was recognised by a number of\\ncompanies as long ago as the early 1970s when VAT was first introduced in\\nthe UK. They have operated the system successfully since then, and with at\\nleast tacit approval from Customs and Excise evidenced by their\\ndiscretionary agreement to the use of monthly returns.\\nHowever, for reasons that have never been made clear, Customs took exception\\nto the scheme operated by Philips. Philips' appeal went first to the VAT\\nTribunal where Philips lost; then to the High Court in May last year where\\nCustoms conceded defeat having agreed the tribunal's decision was wrong.\\nAt the same time, Customs asked the judge, Mr Justice Roch, to give his view\\non the critical point of the tribunal decision - whether or not Philips had\\nmade a 'supply' to the export company.\\nOriginally, Customs had informed Philips that there was in its view no\\nsupply of the goods to the export company and the supply for export was in\\nfact made direct from the manufacturer. Thus there was no tax to be charged\\nbetween the companies and no claim to input tax to be made by the export\\ncompany.\\nThe tribunal supported Customs, saying that if the export company did take\\nownership of the goods at all, it was for so fleeting a moment as to be\\ncompared with an inter-city express train passing through a station. There\\ncould therefore be no supply made under those conditions.\\nIn the High Court the matter was settled by consent, leaving Philips to\\ncontinue with the scheme subject to agreed conditions. In the judge's\\nopinion there was no requirement in the VAT legislation as to the length of\\ntime for which a transferee should have ownership of the goods to establish\\nthat a supply had been made to him.\\nHe went on to make the incisive comment that any other interpretation would\\ncreate considerable difficulties in the levying and recovery of VAT,\\nparticularly in chains of transactions where title might pass\\ninstantaneously through a number of persons.\\nThere is much to be read between the lines in this case. It is clear from\\ntheir conduct of the case that, having argued the point successfully at the\\nVAT Tribunal, Customs suddenly realised that the decision would cause\\nenormous administrative difficulties. This shows an unexpected lack of\\nforesight in a department responsible for an important part of government\\npolicy.\\nIn any event, there was a clean and simple alternative for Customs. Monthly\\nreturns are allowed at the discretion of the commissioners and, if they\\nwished to make Philips an exception to the generally permissive treatment\\naccorded to exporters, the commissioners could have directed Philips Exports\\nLtd to make quarterly returns.\\nThis would have largely erased the cash flow benefit of the scheme to the\\ncompany. To reverse that direction, Philips would have had to show that the\\ncommissioners were behaving unreasonably in denying them the monthly\\nfacility.\\nWhat then prompted Customs to take the action they did? To understand their\\nposition, it must be appreciated that the VAT timing point used in the\\nexport scheme is a general feature of the UK VAT system and can provide a\\nbenefit even without intentional arrangement.\\nAs the quarterly tax periods allocated to businesses for VAT accounting are\\nnot all coincidental (Customs could not cope with 1.4m returns at one time)\\nthere are three different quarterly return groups, the maximum variation in\\nperiod ends being two months.\\nIn large commercial transactions, particularly property transfers, this can\\nbe important because the VAT charge on a sale can be a cash flow cost or a\\nbenefit, depending upon whether the vendor must account to Customs for the\\noutput tax before or after the purchaser obtains the benefit of his claim to\\nthe input tax.\\nThere have been wholly contrived cases, which have demonstrated the timing\\npoint only too well and have rightly been stopped. There was, for instance,\\nthe enterprising individual who registered two businesses with conveniently\\noverlapping VAT periods. He then 'sold' an article of jewellery at a grossly\\ninflated price from one business to the other, thereby creating a charge of\\nVAT which could be claimed as input tax and banked for the remaining time\\nbefore it was to be paid over as output tax by the 'vendor'.\\nNevertheless, it must be said that, in general, Customs have never been too\\nhappy when the timing works against them, despite the rigidity of the tax\\npoint regime which they insist must be observed by taxpayers.\\nWhen VAT was introduced on land and buildings in 1989, it was pointed out to\\nthe department that businesses might suffer if they had to wait for three\\nmonths to claim the substantial input tax on the purchase of new premises.\\nAt that time, Customs said that they would consider making early repayments\\nof tax in such cases, before the normal quarterly period end.\\nIn reality, the position is quite different. Businesses which make unusual\\nclaims to repayment of tax must undergo time-consuming credibility checks\\neven where the claim is made at the normal time. These will frequently\\ninvolve visits from the local VAT office before their claims are approved\\nfor payment. Some of those checks are to ensure that the vendor has properly\\naccounted for the tax which includes a check on the due date for payment.\\nThis attitude is an unnecessary source of annoyance, as well as cost, to the\\ntrading community. On the whole, the VAT system works to the advantage of\\nthe Revenue. However, the system which provides for easily administered,\\nself-assessed tax collection at each stage of the journey from production to\\nfinal consumer inevitably contains in its structure benefits for some\\ntaxpayers. This should be accepted by Customs.\\nFurther, the civil penalty system, progressively introduced since 1985,\\nallows for little or no mitigation when errors or defaults are made by\\ntaxpayers. It is tempered only by a concession that in cases where Customs\\nare extremely late in making repayments Customs will pay a compensation\\nsupplement.\\nBecause these sanctions against underpayment of VAT are heavily biased in\\nfavour of the Revenue it is hard to see the justification for tilting the\\nadministrative balance of the collection system any further in favour of the\\ndepartment. If a realisation of that fact was at least part of the reason\\nfor Customs withdrawing from the Philips case, it would be an encouraging\\nsign of as yet unseen maturity in the administration of VAT.\\nThe author is senior tax manager at City solicitors Ashurst Morris Crisp.\",\n",

The main reason for the March upsurge was, of course, the\\ndesire to beat the April VAT increase. A secondary factor was the early\\nEaster. On a slightly longer view, sales volume fell smartly in the final\\nthree quarters of 1990 and recovered very slightly in the first quarter of\\n1991 to end up half a per cent lower than a year ago. In other words, sales\\nare just about dragging themselves off the bottom.\\nThe trade figures are not now as fashionable as credit and retail sales.\\nThis is partly because the recession has reduced imports, while the\\ndiscovery by the Central Statistical Office of hitherto unrealised invisible\\nearnings has diminished the current deficit by some Pounds 6bn per annum.\\nNevertheless, teenagers found the estimated March current deficit of Pounds\\n432m 'disappointing' and 'double your money'. Why? Because it was twice as\\nhigh than February's erratically low deficit and because the so-called\\nmarket consensus was for a deficit of Pounds 300m.

Indeed, the Treasury issued a mustard-coloured\\npaper, The Relationship between Employment and Wages, in January 1985, with\\nthe unusual by-line 'Review by Treasury Officials', presumably to show\\nrespectability.\\nRespectable or not, the thesis is true - although there is much room to\\nargue about how far the trouble is with money wages, how far with real wages\\nand how far with something more elusive, like real pay objectives.\\nThe Treasury paper, written when ERM was under veto, concentrated on real\\npay and estimated that for every 1 per cent it rose above some appropriate\\nlevel, employment would fall by  1/2 to 1 per cent (other things being\\nequal, which they are usually not).\\nMinisters were, therefore, puzzled and almost embarrassed when unemployment\\nvirtually halved, falling from 11.1 per cent of the workforce in 1986 to a\\nlow of 5.6 per cent in 1990, without any visible wage moderation and indeed\\nsome modest reacceleration as the last boom got going.\\nThe answer to the puzzle is, I am afraid, that part of the fall in\\nunemployment in the late 1980s was unsustainable. Economists who had no\\npolitical axe to grind hesitated to say this for good reasons.\\nThey hoped that there had been a sufficient productivity breakthrough, and\\nnot just a temporary boom-related upsurge, to raise the warranted rate of\\npay growth consistent with high employment. They also hoped that the labour\\nmarket had become more flexible - that is, more responsive to supply and\\ndemand changes - so that pay would respond to any required application of\\nthe economic brakes without having to endure agonies of massive unemployment\\nfirst.\\nThese hopes have obviously proved too optimistic, but more definitely on\\nlabour market flexibility than on productivity. The official estimates\\nshowing annual UK labour cost increases of 11 per cent, based on a 2 per\\ncent fall in productivity for the whole economy are as suspect as the trade\\nfigures were before the statisticians found missing invisibles (see below).\\nProductivity has always moved with the business cycle; but the statisticians\\nmay well have underestimated even year-on-year productivity, which the CBI\\nputs at nearly 4 per cent in manufacturing. Even with that correction,\\nBritish labour costs are still rising by about 5 per cent, compared with 1\\nper cent in Germany.\\nThe real disappointment is that pay should have taken so long to respond to\\nthe slowdown in demand which has been going on for more than two years.\\nEmployers and unions appear to have responded not to fundamentals but to a\\nbackward-looking glance at the headline Retail Prices Index.\\nThere are two aspects of perverse labour markets. One is the rate of\\nunemployment required to maintain in being any reasonably low and stable\\nrate of inflation, once it has been achieved (the so-called NAIRU, or\\nnon-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). The second relates to the\\neven higher transitional unemployment costs of moving from one rate of\\ninflation to a lower one.\\nRecent academic estimates of the UK NAIRU have varied from 6 per cent to 9\\nper cent, or 1.8m to 2.5m. Although much too high, it has, if anything, been\\nslightly less than actual average EC unemployment. The real British disease\\nhas been the even higher transitional unemployment required to achieve each\\npercentage point reduction in inflation.\\nThe late Sir John Hicks used to distinguish between flex-price and fix-price\\neconomies. Flex-price economies respond to a slackening of demand by\\nreductions in pay and prices or in their rate of increase. In fix-price\\nsystems, wages and prices have a large inertia and adjustments are made by\\nmeans of quantity. Stocks pile up, outside purchases are curtailed, and\\nworkers are laid off.\\nThe UK is by and large a fix-price economy. This is shown not only in the\\nstickiness of wage inflation, but of price inflation too in many sectors.\\nEmployers respond to difficulties by cutting outside purchases, trimming\\nstaff; but they reduce list prices or wages only as a last resort.\\nEventually, of course, prices and margins do get trimmed and pay increases\\ndo come down to what the international competition can justify. But after a\\npainfully long interval when many jobs have disappeared.\\nGavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs is very likely right in pointing to the\\nparallel with the corresponding stage of the 1980 recession when both the\\nheadline RPI and pay settlements suddenly fell with astonishing speed - the\\nlatter from 16 1/2 per cent to 9 per cent in the course of the year. This\\ntime Davies expects a drop from 10 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent. The headline\\nRPI will not, of course, be the basic cause of wage de-escalation, but the\\nfig-leaf which will be used to justify it.\\nBut what a cost this fall in pay settlements will have exacted on both\\noccasions. Unemployment is now rising by some 300,000 a quarter and is\\nlikely to be within spitting distance of 3m before the rise tapers off, even\\nassuming a gradual recovery from recession from mid-year onwards.\\nEventually ERM membership should acquire enough credibility to speed up\\nthese adjustments.

Officials at the Bank of\\nEngland, in conjunction with other European central banks, are working on a\\nnovel, highly secret approach to this subject. The FT has stumbled upon a\\nBank briefing paper on the project, part of which we reproduce here.\\nThe European Aggregates Targeting (EAT) programme is aimed at finding\\nmonetary indicators that will faithfully monitor changes in the pan-European\\neconomy. That is no mean task, given the range of economic and cultural\\nconditions across the continent.\\nBritain's role in EAT can be traced to the mid-1980s. Disillusioned with the\\nperformance of existing monetary aggregates, a small team of Bank officials\\nstarted work on a Grand Unifying Theory (GUT) of monetary targeting. The\\ngroup explored new thinking that went beyond conventional monetarist\\neconomics. It drew on people skilled not just in this field but in\\nbiochemistry, an area where Britain has a world reputation for innovation.\\nThe GUT team's radical approach paid off with the theory that changes in the\\nUK money supply could be modelled on genetically-induced interactions during\\nthe digestion of food. The influences of genetic programming on this process\\nwere found to be similar to the way that factors such as wage claims,\\nunemployment and production efficiencies affect the money supply.\\nThe practical relevance of the GUT ideas was established in a programme of\\ntests, which used human volunteers with a range of genetic characteristics.\\nVirtually all aspects to the trials were satisfactory. Outbreaks of\\ninflation were characterised in the GUT model by localised physiological\\ndisturbences. Ingestion of specific foods accurately simulated external\\neconomic shocks; lobster for an England cricket victory, rice pudding for an\\noil-price rise and a well-grilled steak for a broadside from the Bundesbank\\non price control.\\nMore quantitatively, the studies held out the prospect of a new regime of\\nmonetary indicators - code-named Biological Universal-Rule Parameters, or\\nBURPs - which would be far better than any previous monetary aggregates.\\nMr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, was elated with the project's success. But\\nMrs Thatcher, then prime minister, was more sceptical; apart from her own\\npersonal disagreements with Mr Lawson, she had little confidence in the\\npractical capabilities of UK biochemists, whom she had never forgiven for\\nfailing to patent monoclonal antibodies.\\nAfter Mr Lawson resigned in 1989, the GUT work foundered - until Mr John\\nMajor took over as prime minister and recognised its significance to Emu. Mr\\nMajor, whose straightforward eating habits based around a liking for ice\\ncream and brown sauce are well known, was instinctively attracted to the GUT\\nconcept. He also seized upon the work as a demonstration of how Britain\\ncould use its capabilities in the monetary field to the benefit of Europe,\\nfollowing up the UK's pioneering studies on the hard Ecu currency. After Mr\\nMajor broached the matter over dinner with the other European heads of\\nstate, EAT was born.\\nEAT has led to the establishment of several loosely linked projects across\\nEurope. Germany, France and Denmark have led the way with a joint effort,\\nthe Strategic Alliance Aimed at Monetary Indicators (SALAMI). Italy has its\\nProvisional Attempt at Short-Term Aggregates (PASTA) project, while Spain is\\nworking on the Critical Inflation-Target Reduction Scheme (CITRUS).\\nEAT has found that, despite the cross-border differences in genetic\\nprogramming and eating habits, the same basic theories hold across the\\nentire continent. Although it is too early to be sure, we can hold out the\\nhope that ultimately EAT will produce an all-encompassing monetary index for\\nEurope, provisionally labelled the Highly Operational Target Aimed at\\nInflation Reduction, otherwise known as HOTAIR.\",\n",

If the two most\\npowerful politicians in the Soviet Union can suppress their personal dislike\\nin favour of a political accord with clearly stated aims, the Soviet Union\\nmay have a period in which it can peacefully dis-unite.\\nWestern aid\\nSuch an accord is essential if the country is to receive any of the western\\naid, investment and technical assistance it must have.\\nThere is, however, another large question: is the reform which the\\nrepublican leaders have agreed to support - the anti-crisis plan - actually\\nserious? Mr Pavlov says he wants to use the power of the state to effect\\nnecessary sacrifices, steady the currency, balance the budget and increase\\nproduction. He has recognised explicitly that a socialist economy with no\\nfear factor cannot work.\\nBut he also plans (small) privatisations this year and larger ones next. He\\nurges entrepreneurial behaviour. He has already pushed through price rises,\\nand has even freed some from state control.\\nThere is much room for doubt. Many - not all - of the radical economists\\nassociated with a more rapid dash for the market distrust Mr Pavlov deeply:\\nafter all, as finance minister, he was responsible for debauching the\\ncurrency. He talks too easily of coercion, of states of emergency and of\\nforce.\\nBut if, in the fleshing out of his programme, he really is prepared to\\nbequeath decision making to the market-oriented republics and, more\\nimportantly, to the enterprises; if he really can provide some space for\\nmarket behaviour and not simultaneously woo it and beat it, as Mr Nikolai\\nRyzhkov, his predecessor, did; if he can keep the apparatus at bay - then he\\nmay prove to be a reformer after all. And then the Soviet economy may have a\\nchance, even if it is a slim one.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3360': \"GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY: IN SEARCH OF A NEW WORLD ETHIC\\nBy Hans Kung\\nSCM Press Pounds 12.95, 158 pages\\nThis is a small mountain of a book. Its sides are steep and climbed only\\nwith frequent pauses for breath, but the view from the top is worth the\\nexertion.\\nThe difficulty of the climb stems from the author's ambition. Hans Kung, the\\nprolific Catholic theologian whose teaching licence was withdrawn by the\\nVatican in 1979, uses this short work to outline his plan to spend the\\ncoming years examining the history and theology of Christianity, Judaism and\\nIslam in pursuit of a secure, ethical basis for world peace. The spirit of\\nthe enterprise is captured in the book's German title: Projekt Weltethos.\\nWhat a project]\\nBut this is not a book for a closed theological fraternity. Dedicated to a\\nformer Bundesbank president, one chunk of the thesis was shared with a\\nmomentous meeting of the Davos World Economic Forum in February 1990.\\nIn style, the book swerves between brilliantly compressed summaries of, for\\nexample, theories of world history (Hegel to Toynbee) and slideshow slogans.\\nIts final words read:\\nno human life together without a world ethic for the nations;\\nno peace among the nations without peace among the religions;\\nno peace among the religions without dialogue among the religions.\\nKung's thesis states that 'our new, post-colonialist, polycentric age, in\\npost-modernity' needs an agreed ethos which only religion can provide;\\npost-modernism, in his view, set in about 1918. Among its identifying\\nfeatures are technologies capable both of drawing people together\\n(telecommunications) and destroying the planet (nuclear weapons and\\nenvironmental mis-management). And yet in this world of information\\noverload, there is a simultaneous tendency for old individualisms, cultures,\\nnationalisms and religions to re-assert themselves, most powerfully and\\nobviously in the Islamic world.\\nKung accepts that 'those who have no religion can also lead a life which is\\nauthentically human and in this sense moral', but he argues that without\\nreligion there is no absolute or unconditional reason to adhere to or to\\nrequire adherence to religion's essential tenets: don't kill, don't lie,\\ndon't steal, respect parents, love children and avoid immorality. Only\\nreligion, he says, has shown itself capable of leading and influencing whole\\npopulations, regardless of background and education.\\nAlthough Kung's unmistakably central European timbre betrays a hint of the\\nevangelist, he makes a specific pitch for unbelievers to join this great\\ndialogue on the grounds that even if you resist the claims of belief, you\\ncannot deny the political and social importance of the fact that millions do\\nbelieve.\\nKung thus seeks at once to be open-minded, but loyal to his own creed:\\nsteadfastness and self-criticism are the essential qualities he identifies\\nfor the task ahead.\\nWhat, though, is the common threat which binds the great religions? For\\nKung, the answer is 'the humanum', or basic human values. 'Religion,' he\\nwrites, 'is true and good to the degree that it serves humanity, to the\\ndegree that . . . it advances men and women in their identity, sense of\\nmeaning and sense of dignity, and allows them to attain a meaningful and\\nfruitful existence.' The thread is thus clearly aspiration rather than\\nachievement, and perhaps even as aspiration it is too much the work of a\\npost-Englightenment European mind to carry the weight the author gives it.\\nIt would be wrong, however, to imply that Kung is unaware of the\\nEurocentricity of his intellectual heritage. He rejects both Hegel's and\\nSpengler's seminal theories of history partly on the grounds that they\\nignore or marginalise Judaism and Islam. Arnold Toynbee, the British\\nhistorian, is viewed more favourably, but still found wanting in his groping\\nfor some synthesised 'world religion'. Kung is surely right to recognise\\nthat religions will remain stubbornly factional; the best that can be hoped\\nis that they learn to love dialogue more than they enjoy militancy.\\nAs we look from Prof Kung's mountain top, it is not surprising to see\\npatches of haze. In his opening survey of the state of the world, for\\nexample, he dismisses Japanese moral and spiritual life with a\\nsuperficiality which seems over-influenced by newspaper stories about recent\\nscandals in politics and business.\\nBut mostly, we should be thankful for Hans Kung and his motivating judgment,\\nthat religion remains decisive in human affairs and that peace, if it is to\\nbe found anywhere, lies along the road of intelligent and well-researched\\ndialogue. Kung, an antidote to the conservatism of the current Vatican, is\\nthe kind of intellectual the late 20th century needs; thorough, engaged and\\nwith a global perspective.\\nTowards the end of the book, he mentions in passing the great protestant\\ntheologian, Paul Tillich, who gave a lecture in Chicago in 1965, recognising\\nthe need to re-work a lifetime of systematic theology in the light of his\\nemerging understanding of world religion. Ten days later, he died. As Kung\\napproaches his mid-sixties, with Projekt Weltethos before him, we can only\\nwish him a long and active old age.\",\n",

Tuckett is\\njust starting to make his way as a choreographer with creations for both\\nhalves of the Royal Ballet. He is still young, and I am not persuaded that\\nthe chance to compose for a modern dance troupe is the best means of\\nextending his skills. For Slippage he has chosen a score of minimalist\\nchatter by Dan Jones, music that provides nothing to sustain choreographic\\ninvention save the dubious merit of continuing to do what it has already\\ndone at interminable length. The chief incidents of the piece amount to the\\ndancers peeling off layers of clothes - dull, and by Candida Cook - to\\nreveal themselves in dreary underwear (one chap looks like Captain Webb\\nabout to embark upon the English Channel).\\nThe dance, like the score, goes on. Four couples leap and walk, droop and\\nrace over the stage, and part of the choreography has the innocent\\nspringiness I associate with revivals of the sacred texts of early Denishawn\\ndance of 60 years ago.

When she steps on\\nto her son's rickety little stage, after ridiculing his play off it, the\\nstructure shakes under her weight, its little proscenium arch no match for\\nher voluminous coiffure.\\nOne can well imagine her appeal to a restless spirit like Trigorin, who\\ncould simply bury his sense of inadequacy in her massive bulk; likewise, she\\nmakes it woefully clear why her son, Konstantin, has never grown up. Michael\\nMueller presents a man spiritually and materially squashed by a mother who\\nbandages his head one minute and hurls insults at him the next. 'While I'm\\naway, you won't go click-click again,' she beseeches him. It is the nearest\\nshe gets to acknowledging his desperation, her choice of childish euphemism\\nunderlining her childlike refusal to face his attempted suicide.\\nThe refusal is so complete that it makes a charade of her attempt to prevent\\nTrigorin from leaving her for the younger Nina.

Oliver Stone's film The Doors\\nseems infinite, though it lasts a mere 141 minutes. Yet it shows not the\\nremotest perception of what was 'infinite' in the Blake-ian sense about The\\nDoors' music. Even I, a non-rockomane, recognise in Jim Morrison's\\nbroody-thunderous songs a power born of some pyromaniac vision in the soul.\\nStone's vision is the same as the one he brought to Platoon and Born On The\\nFourth Of July. Well-upholstered hyperbole drives on the story, with a few\\ntinny morals attached like cans to a wedding car.

No human being\\ndwells inside the mad eyes and the marijuana'd wisecracks. ('I don't\\nremember being born,' he tells a reporter, 'it must have been during one of\\nmy blackouts'). This Morrison was a bio-pic legend even before he was born.\\nThe whole film starts with the assumption of immortality then tries to climb\\nhigher into Rock Era inspirationalism. Socking on through concert after\\nconcert (mixing real and staged footage), traversing ever dottier sexual\\nskirmishes with girlfriend Meg Ryan or groupie Kathleen Quinlan ('Have you\\never tried drinking blood?'), the story's ascent is interrupted only by the\\nodd dutiful attempt to 'explain' Morrison. He may have been traumatised as a\\nchild by the sight of a roadside accident (cue surreally bleached\\nflashback). Or he may have been a free soul spurred to revolt by society's\\nmoral pressures or the Vietnam war or . . . What the hell.

The film could have been a pop-world mockumentary in the style\\nof This Is Spinal Tap, but its funny lines are strictly unintentional. ('I\\nhad enough of this shit with Janis,' screams a studio manager at a\\nmisbehaving Morrison). It could have confined itself to what it does best:\\nre-constructing the concerts via fact and fiction. Stone comes into his\\nbarnstorming own here: the thousands of extras are whipped into a plausible\\nfrenzy, as the air crackles to 'Come on, baby, light my fire' or 'This is\\nthe end.' At these moments Morrison-fever means something. Elsewhere in The\\nDoors it means only Hollywood's latest bid to be with it by jumping on a\\nbandwagon that vanished 20 years ago.\\nWhite Palace starts out as a steamy slice of erotic life only to end up a\\nsoggy May-December romance. Max (James Spader) is an effete Yuppie adman who\\nis emotionally scarred by the accidental death of his wife. He seems\\ndestined for a life of tortured celibacy until he meets Nora (Susan\\nSarandon), a brassy hamburger waitress 16 years his senior. Against all the\\nodds, the two fall madly in love, bonded not only by intense sexual desire\\nbut also by shared tragedy - Nora lost her teenage son to drugs. Their first\\nfew dates see them proceeding all the way from the sofa to the waterbed,\\nwith Nora using her considerable skills and experience to draw Max out of\\nhis cocoon of impotent self-pity.\\nSo fa so good. In these opening scenes director Lius Mandoki elicits the\\nfilm's erotic tension with a steady, stylish hand. Spader's unctuous\\nself-containment, reminiscent of his fine performance in sex, lies and\\nvideotape, is perfect for his character, while Sarandon is eminently\\nbelievable as a woman determined to keep middle age at bay by sheer sensual\\nwill. Unfortunately, their energy flags about a half-hour into the film,\\ntransforming it into a quirky love story far less engrossing than the\\ninitial pyrotechnics promised. There's a squabble over a vacuum cleaner, an\\nembarrassing visit by Nora's clairvoyant sister (Eileen Brennan), and the\\ninevitable confrontation when Max brings his older, declasse girl home to\\nmeet family and friends. Sarandon is much less convincing making impassioned\\npleas for the working class to Spader's smug relations than she is showing\\nhim the sensual ropes. After all this soppy domesticity, it comes as little\\nsurprise that heir final reconciliation is sealed with a chaste, public\\nkiss, in which eroticism is joked about rather than explored.\\nIt also comes as little surprise that Bill Murray plays a robber in Quick\\nChange. There can be few more apt roles for one of modern cinema's most\\nadept scene stealers. In fact, everything about this light, engaging comedy\\nsuits Murray perfectly, lending him a perfect vehicle for his wry asides and\\ndeadpan double-takes. He plays an ambitious thief who, with the help of a\\nclown suit, a sexy girlfriend (Geena Davis) and a doltish sidekick (Randy\\nQuaid), pulls off what just might be the perfect bank heist. Unfortunately,\\nthe one thing that he doesn't take into account is making his getaway\\nthrough New York City, portrayed here as a thoroughly moronic inferno.\\nManiacal bus drivers, lovelorn Mafia wiseguys and urban jousters conspire to\\nturn a simple trip to Kennedy Airport into a tortuous adventure.\\nMurray deadpans his way through it all with consummate skill, particularly\\nin the opening scenes when he takes over the bank. Despite attempts at\\nbroadening his character with hints of a traumatic Vietnam past and a\\nromantic entanglement with Davis, he never stops being Bill Murray, even\\nwhen hidden behind a fright wig and white face. Everybody else - including\\nNew York - plays off him with varying degrees of success. His fans will not\\nbe disappointed.\\nFans of the triumvirate headlining Scenes from a Mall - Paul Mazursky, Woody\\nAllen and Bette Midler - will be less satisfied. Everything is in place here\\nfor a wonderful comedy, with the veteran satirist Mazursky directing Allen\\nand Midler as a successful Beverly Hills couple (she's a best-selling author\\nof psychobabble, he's a sports lawyer) publicly feuding their way through\\ntheir 16th wedding anniversary. The movie is strangely flat, however,\\ndespite an occasionally trenchant script by the director and Roger L. Simon.\\nThe problem, surprisingly, is with the leads, who suffer from a\\ndisappointing lack of chemistry. When mixed, these two potent and precious\\nelements fizzle out rather than ignite. Allen bravely plays against his\\nusual screen persona, sporting a pony tail and singing the praises of Los\\nAngeles, but is never altogether convincing. Nor is Midler, whose frenetic\\nmastery is only sometimes glimpsed, such as when she publicly pelts her\\nwayward husband with sushi. For the most part, she's as subdued and aimless\\nas the picture itself.\\nIt's a shame that Wings of Fame isn't a bit more subdued. In it, Peter\\nO'Toole plays a pompous actor who is gunned down by a deranged fan (Colin\\nFirth). When the assassin perishes as well, their spirits are barged to the\\nnetherworld, depicted here as a posh island hotel inhabited by famously dead\\nsouls. It is a last resort of sumptuous comfort and profound ennui -\\nHemingway shoots clay pigeons, Einstein saws away at his fiddle, even Lassie\\nmakes an appearance, lurking in the bushes. All wait in dread of the moment\\nwhen their earthly fame runs out and they will be consigned to the much less\\ncozy mists of oblivion.\\nDespite the overblown symbolism of hooded boatmen, cadaverous bellhops and\\nblindfolded archers, writer/director Otakar Votocek has a simple point to\\nmake - in a godless world, fame is the only form of immortality going. He\\nwould have fared far better to ease up on the skewered allegory and focus on\\nthe complex relationship between O'Toole and Firth, who both labour\\nheroically to salvage the film from its pretensions.

The department is keen to dispell any\\nimpression that it is using taxpayers' money to help a company's advertising\\ncampaign.\\nNo product is endorsed - 'we don't say buy this or buy that' - nor are there\\nany exclusive arrangements. For instance, Mothercare and Elastoplast are\\nalso involved in the child cyclist campaign.\\nBecause of the delicacy of the relationship, Miller & Leeves WAHT, the\\nadvertising agency used by the DoT, is careful which companies are invited\\nto take part. Peter Jones, the director responsible, says: 'Part of our\\nremit is to find companies interested in the marketing of road safety.'\\nOne company Jones describes as having a suitable track record is Kwik-Fit,\\nthe tyre and exhaust company. It is contributing to publicity about new\\nlegislation which, from July 1, will make it compulsory for adult back-seat\\ncar passengers to wear safety belts.\\nThe law applying to children came into force in 1989, when Kwik-Fit mounted\\nits original 'Belt up in the Back' campaign.\\nPeter Holmes, marketing director of the Edinburgh-based company, says it\\nfirst ventured into the safety area in 1987 when it launched its offer to\\nfit toddler safety seats for Pounds 34.90, with the promise to take back the\\nseat and refund the money once the child had reached the age of four.\\nThe rear seat-belt legislation, however, can only go so far; it can only be\\nenforced if the belts are already fitted and the DoT estimates that a third\\nof the UK's 19m cars do not have them. Part of Kwik-Fit's role will be to\\noffer a fitting service.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3369': \"The fiercest marketing battle for 30 years has broken out in the once sedate\\nworld of publishing television programme schedules.\\nThis has been generated by the British government's decision to end the\\nduopoly of programme listings held by TV Times and the BBC's Radio Times.\\nThe market, at least in theory, is now open to any publisher willing to pay\\nfor the information under licence.\\nAs a result, the established titles and the new entrants are jockeying for\\nposition and market share; as much as Pounds 20m has been spent on\\nadvertising and promotion.\\nThere has even been the first casualty - one of the new entrants, TV Plus,\\ncollapsed after only three issues. Some potential players didn't even make\\nit to the starting line; the Daily Telegraph closed its television magazine\\n7 Days before deregulation and Rupert Murdoch's candidate, the British\\nversion of the US TV Guide veered off to concentrate on satellite TV\\nprogrammes.\\n'This market is not for the faint-hearted,' says John Matthews, managing\\ndirector of Independent Television Publications - with more than a touch of\\nunderstatement. ITP is the publisher of TV Times and a cheaper entrant to\\nthe market, What's On TV.\\nUntil March 1 viewers who wanted advanced listings had to pay 50p each for\\nTV Times and the Radio Times. Just over 3m households regularly bought a\\nprogramme journal; about 88 per cent of them bought both. This amounted to\\nonly 15 per cent of households with a television compared with 80 per cent\\nin the Netherlands, 30 per cent in France and 28 per cent in Italy.\\nIn the UK now there are four paid-for magazines giving all the programmes\\nincluding those on satellite; at least two more are under consideration.\\nBritain's two leading popular newspapers, The Sun and the Daily Mirror, now\\ninclude special listings supplements in Saturday's editions which cover the\\nwhole week's programmes.\\nBut this has potentially tricky consequences; circulation on Saturdays has\\nincreased but sales for the rest of the week have gone down. Robert Maxwell,\\nthe publisher of Mirror Group Newspapers, says that he will review the\\nsituation in two months.\\nTime Out magazine has seen a significant increase in circulation since it\\nhas been carrying full TV listings. The full week's listings are also\\navailable in the popular celebrity magazine, Hello.\\nBut the publication to have made the most significant entry to the scene\\ncomes from the German publisher, H Bauer. Having scored two successes in the\\nUK women's weekly market with Bella and Take A Break, and planned its move\\nfor nearly two years, Bauer then sat out the first four weeks of the\\nliberalised market before launching TV Quick with all guns blazing.\\n'We really wanted to be sure that the product was absolutely right before we\\nlaunched,' says Alan Urry, managing director of Bauer in the UK, who\\nexplains that the company had wanted to allow a little of the dust to\\nsettle.\\nSome of that dust settled on TV Plus which, after an estimated initial sale\\nof 500,000, sank to 220,000 and closed; Hamfield Publications, the company\\nbehind it, went into receivership before TV Quick even appeared. Bauer aimed\\nTV Quick unashamedly at the mass market with a cut-throat cover price of 10p\\nfor its first four weeks and backed it with a saturation television\\nadvertising campaign.\\nThe strategy behind the pricing policy was to get as many people as possible\\nto sample the magazine; it seems to have achieved its objective. Between\\n1.85m and 1.9m were sold of the first two issues, giving TV Quick an early\\nlead over both TV Times and Radio Times.\\nAccording to Urry, between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m was spent on the launch.\\nFor its first four weeks, Bauer gave the 10p straight to the newsagents,\\npaid the wholesalers a distribution fee and shouldered the entire production\\ncosts without revenue. The true test of its circulation will come when TV\\nQuick charges an economic price that Urry says will be between 35p and 45p.\\nOver at ITP, Matthews has also placed considerable emphasis on price-cutting\\nas a device to draw attention to the fact that TV Times now has news of all\\nTV programmes. For the first three weeks of the new competitive era TV Times\\nhalved its cover price to 25p.\\nRadio Times was forced to respond - but John Thomas, managing director of\\nBBC Publications did not cut the magazine's cover price - although the\\neffect for the consumer was similar. The BBC seized on the fact that the\\nsecond week after deregulation coincided with Comic Relief, when comedians\\nand the public raise money for charity. The Corporation announced that\\nduring the last two weeks of the special offer at TV Times the BBC would\\ndonate half its 50p cover price to Comic Relief.\\n'We were absolutely appalled that TV Times cut its price - thus devaluing a\\nvery well established brand in the marketplace,' Thomas argues. But TV\\nTimes's Matthews says the price reduction was both planned and necessary and\\nwas a strategy that worked.\\nThe second string to ITP's bow grew out of research which showed that while\\nmany consumers wanted detailed programme information, others wanted their\\nlistings in a more concentrated form.\\nTo meet this latter market and to try to extend the company's market share,\\nWhat's On TV, complete with a free TV planner board with the first issue,\\nwas launched. What's on TV began at a discount price of 25p and had a single\\nweek at 35p before having to match TV Quick's 10p cover price.\\nAfter a total ITP promotional spend of Pounds 10m by week six What's on TV\\nhad a circulation of around 600,000 and TV Times claims its circulation was\\n1.7m, down from 3.1m before deregulation.\\nFalls in circulation of both TV Times and Radio Times were expected as\\ndouble buying of the titles fell away; the BBC says Radio Times sales fell\\nfrom 2.16m to 1.72m. The Corporation's promotional costs were about Pounds\\n5m including more than Pounds 1m spent on commercial television. It also had\\nconsiderable support on BBC television channels.\\nThomas believes deregulation is leading to a polarisation of the market. The\\nBBC claims that more than 50 per cent of Radio Times readers are ABCIs, the\\nprofessional and managerial classes, compared with a TV Times figure in the\\nmid-30s. 'We think the UK public is realising what this is all about; there\\nis now an opportunity to increase the market not through pyrotechnics but\\nthrough careful promotion to distinct segments,' says Thomas.\\nHe has researched a new listings title which could be launched later this\\nyear, but refuses to say at which sector of the market it would be aimed.\\nITP, too, has plans for a third title - a glossy upmarket magazine - but no\\ndecision has yet been taken on whether to bring them to fruition.\\nThomas says he would be amazed if another mainstream British publisher were\\nto enter the market now 'with the blood still drying on the wall', although\\nfurther interest from non-UK publishers could not be ruled out.\\nIn two or three years' time when the market has settled down, Matthews\\nforecasts there will be five paid-for listings magazines in the UK with\\ntotal sales of more than 6m, 1m more than at present - a far cry from the\\nlast time all Britain's broadcasting listings were available in a single\\nmagazine: the Radio Times of the 1950s sold more than 10m copies a week.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3370': \"Bombarded by the pressures of recession British managers might be forgiven\\nfor putting plans for innovation to one side. But they would be gambling\\nwith their company's future.\\nAs the director of one of the UK's leading electronics companies puts it:\\n'We cut back research and development for 1988. We are still reaping the\\nharvest of this decision, which has left us 1.5 product generations behind\\nthe competition. We are faced with the choice of leapfrogging generations or\\ngetting out of the business.'\\nInnovation is becoming increasingly central to competition. It is no longer\\nenough to produce low-cost, high-quality items. Product ranges must be\\nrenewed constantly to take advantage of the quickening pace of technological\\nchange and create distinctive products which can command a niche in\\ninternational markets.\\nThe Confederation of British Industry's Innovation Trends survey* published\\non Monday showed that UK companies have had little success in reducing the\\ntime it takes them to develop new products. Yet the need for new products is\\nbecoming more pressing. Companies reporting that the lifespan for their\\nproducts had shortened outweighed those who said it had lengthened by almost\\n10 to one. About 40 per cent said they needed to replace their product\\nranges within three years.\\nThe innovative capacity of an economy is a key index of its strength. The\\nimpact of the recession upon the UK's innovative potential will have\\nimplications for the health of the economy long after the recession is\\nformally declared over. Cuts in investment in 1990-91 might allow dividends\\nto be maintained in the teeth of recession. But by the mid-1990s companies\\nmay find their product development pipelines have run dangerously dry.\\nBritain entered the recession with a record for innovation which was at best\\nmixed. The main source of industry's renewed competitiveness in the last\\ndecade was a leap in productivity. Between 1980 and 1987 output per person\\nemployed in the UK rose in real terms by 24 per cent, compared with 22 per\\ncent in Japan, between 12 per cent and 14 per cent in Germany, Italy and\\nFrance and about 7 per cent in the US. But have British manufacturers become\\nmore efficient at developing new products?\\nA House of Lords select committee report** published earlier this year says\\nthat many UK manufacturers invest too little in new or improved products,\\nplants or systems. 'They rely on doing what they have done in the past and\\nfail to seize new opportunities created by changing customer demand. As a\\nresult their competitiveness declines.'\\nGross domestic expenditure on research and development fell in the UK\\nbetween 1981 and 1988, but rose in France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US.\\nPublic spending on R&D fell markedly while industry spending rose from about\\n1.2 per cent of GDP to about 1.25 per cent. This compares with a rise in\\nGerman industry's expenditure from 1.4 per cent of GDP to 1.8 per cent.\\nBritish electronics groups such as GEC have been criticised for avoiding\\ntechnologically important areas such as the mass production of\\nsemiconductors. In retrospect this looks like a sensible decision as all the\\nbig European semiconductor manufacturers - Siemens of Germany, Philips of\\nthe Netherlands and SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian joint venture - are\\nlosing money hand over fist on chips.\\nAt best Britain's relative technological decline may have been arrested. It\\nhas definitely not been reversed and there are signs that it has continued.\\nIs the British innovation system strong enough to withstand the battering of\\nrecession?\\nOver the last 15 months the outlook for innovation has deteriorated in line\\nwith the fall in confidence among manufacturers, according to the CBI. In\\nOctober 1989 a balance of about 35 per cent of manufacturers expected to\\nincrease their expenditure upon innovation in the year ahead. By January of\\nthis year the balance had turned negative - more companies expected to\\nreduce their expenditure than those expecting to increase it.\\nYet it seems possible that innovation may not be cut back as far as other\\ncosts and the cuts will fall unevenly across the economy. Throughout last\\nyear manufacturers remained quite bullish about their spending on innovation\\neven though they had become deeply pessimistic about the business outlook.\\nThis may mean that innovation spending could get away with a shave rather\\nthan a cut, as long as confidence recovers soon (see graph).\\nMoreover cuts in innovation are likely to be spread unevenly across the\\neconomy. The recession will widen the gap between those sectors where\\nBritain has well-established strengths, built upon heavy research and\\ndevelopment spending, and those where it is weak because it has\\nunderinvested in the past. The recession will amplify the difference between\\nthese two sectors.\\nChemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers are the most buoyant about the\\noutlook for innovation. A positive balance of 20 per cent of companies in\\nthe chemicals sector still expect to spend more on innovation in the coming\\nyear. Only 18 per cent think their spending is less than adequate. The UK\\nentered the recession with a strong position in chemicals and\\npharmaceuticals and is likely to retain it.\\nIn contrast the mechanical engineering sector is among the weakest in\\nmanufacturing, with one of the poorest investment records in the 1980s. In\\nthis sector the outlook for innovation is poor. A negative balance of 10 per\\ncent of companies expect to spend less on innovation. About 44 per cent of\\ncompanies believe their innovation spending is inadequate. This sector will\\nbe made weaker by the recession.\\nYet it would be complacent to assume that areas of traditional strength will\\nescape unscathed. The defence-related areas of aerospace and electronics are\\ncases in point. Within the overall recession is a specific defence recession\\nbrought on by cuts in military expenditure.\\nDefence accounts for 51 per cent of UK government spending on research and\\ndevelopment and 20 per cent of total UK research and development. Defence is\\none of Britain's specialisms. Military research feeds much of the civil\\naerospace and electronics industries. Thus the British innovation system\\nwill be particularly hit by cuts in defence-related research.\\nA development which may counterbalance the decline in defence is the\\nincrease in foreign investment in innovation in the UK. The share of British\\nR&D accounted for by foreign companies rose from 4 per cent in 1967 to 13\\nper cent in 1986. In areas such as consumer electronics and automobile\\nassembly the UK has become almost wholly dependent upon foreign groups. In\\nthe long run the prospects for innovation in the UK will increasingly turn\\nupon whether large foreign groups choose to complement their UK\\nmanufacturing plants with research facilities.\\nSmall companies may fare worse than larger groups. The CBI survey found that\\n45 per cent of companies which employ fewer than 50 people felt their\\nspending on innovation was inadequate, compared with 30 per cent of\\ncompanies employing between 1,000 and 5,000.\\nInnovation is the product of a complex process involving a range of\\ningredients. It seems likely that companies will cut back on some elements\\nof innovation, while continuing to invest in others. According to the CBI,\\nin manufacturing as a whole investment in formal R&D will fall this year.\\nYet there could be an expansion in the resources devoted to other elements\\nof innovation such as training. David Lees, chairman and chief executive of\\nGKN, the automotive and industrial services group, says: 'In 1980 we cut\\nback on training. This time we will not do that.'\\nJoint ventures with foreign companies are set to expand. About 50 per cent\\nof manufacturers are planning to put more effort into joint ventures which\\nbring access to technology, according to the CBI. Some groups such as Smiths\\nIndustries in aerospace and John Brown in engineering pride themselves upon\\nbeing highly skilled buyers, integrators and appliers of technology to\\nspecific markets rather than inventing it in house.\\nPerhaps most importantly the best British companies have developed a\\nmanagement culture of continuous, incremental improvement to products and\\nprocesses which will continue through the recession.\\nIndeed one beneficial side-effect of this recession may be to expose the\\nrelative fragility of the British approach to innovation. In the wake of the\\n1980-81 recession government policy and management effort was directed at\\nimproving labour productivity, through trade union reform, de-manning and\\nthe introduction of reformed working practices. The recession of 1990-91 may\\nwell yield a different, and altogether more complicated, task - to shore up\\nand strengthen the British capacity to innovate.\\n* CBI Innovation Trends Survey, Issue Number 2, available from Centre Point,\\nNew Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU.

All members, except the Bahamas which is not\\na signatory of the trading agreements, have said they will implement the\\ncommon tariff.\\nThe proposed tariff structure promises low rates of duty on imports which do\\nnot compete with goods produced within the community, but sets high rates on\\nany imports likely to injure domestic industry. Under the new tariff the\\nhighest rate of duty will be 45 per cent and the lowest 5 per cent. This\\nreplaces a structure where tariffs range from 5 per cent to 70 per cent.\\nThe new measures will streamline the three different tariff structures used\\nin the community. Rates will differ where imports are raw materials or\\nfinished products, and agricultural products will be given protection while\\ninputs for agriculture will be subject to low tariffs.\\n'There is need for the common external tariff to stimulate production in the\\ncommunity,' said Mr Hayden Blades, director of trade and agriculture for the\\nCommunity secretariat.\\n'But the tariff structure must not encourage inefficient production. The\\ntariffs have to be set at levels which will allow regional industry to be\\ncompetitive,' he said.\\nIn effect, however, most of the smaller Community members, in particular the\\nsmaller islands of the eastern Caribbean, and Belize on mainland central\\nAmerica, will have to raise their import duties, while the more developed\\ncountries (Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Guyana) will be\\nlowering theirs.\\nThis has led some government officials in the smaller states to be concerned\\nabout the inflationary impact of the common tariff.\\nMr Charles Maynard, trade minister of Dominica, says the the new\\narrangements will have to be constantly monitored to determine the impact on\\nthe cost of living 'so we can decide, at the level of the Community's\\nMinisterial Council whether we need to revise it upwards of downwards'.\\nSeveral governments have become dependent on revenues from import duties,\\nand have moved to cushion the expected loss of income with the lowering of\\ntariffs. The Jamaican government has imposed a sales tax on some imports on\\nwhich duties have been reduced.\\nThe new tariff offers greater protection to the fledgling industries of the\\nsmaller community members, while presenting increased competition to\\nbusinesses in the larger countries. The community's industrial sector is\\nbased on light manufacturing and the assembly and re-export of consumer\\ndurables.\\nThe changes caused by the new arrangements have unsettled some\\nmanufacturers. Mr Anthony Robinson, president of the Jamaica Manufacturers\\nAssociation, has complained that the implementation of the common external\\ntariff has exacerbated differences in the level of competitiveness among the\\nCaribbean Community members.\\nMr Robinson said Jamaican manufacturers may be forced to close or reduce\\noperations because '. . . our Community competitors pay no duty on raw\\nmaterials, and having made the products, ship them here at between 14 per\\ncent and 21 per cent less than it costs Jamaican manufacturers to ship\\nproducts to other parts of the Community.'\\nMr Compton argued that the Caribbean Community has no option but to\\nimplement measures such as the common external tariff. 'It will take some\\nsacrifice, there might be short-term adjustments and we must be prepared to\\nbear these sacrifices if the Caribbean is to adjust itself economically to\\nmeet the challenges of the outside world.'\",\n",

As a family-run establishment, Athens' best-known\\nluxury hotel could barely make ends meet, with occupancy averaging only 55\\nper cent in recent years.\\nCiga is expected to invest considerably in refurbishing to bring the Grande\\nBretagne's facilities up to the standard of its other traditional luxury\\nhotels around Europe. 'The presence of a really top-quality hotel in Athens\\nwill upgrade the surrounding area and encourage other hotels to try harder,'\\nsays Mr Iatrakos.\\nThe government is already trying to ensure that older first-class hotels\\naround Greece, including some in spectacular settings, are upgraded to the\\nstandards of increasingly demanding guests. It is breaking up a\\nstate-controlled hotel chain and offering individual units to private\\noperators on long-term leases.\\nImproving hotel facilities is one of the easier ways of attracting more\\nolder, wealthier tourists, something Greece has been trying to do for years\\nbut without conspicuous success.\\nWith 433,000 hotel beds, Greece has no shortage of accommodation. But many\\nlarge island resort hotels built in the boom years of the 1970s have not\\nbeen maintained to international tour operators' standards. Occupancy levels\\nin Corfu and Rhodes have slipped in recent years.\\nIt is no coincidence that the one area where bookings picked up sharply once\\nthe Gulf war ended was Crete, which boasts some of the best-run hotels in\\nGreece. Last year the island drew over 1.7m tourists, close to 25 per cent\\nof total arrivals.\\n'Large-scale tourism didn't start in Crete till the early 1980s. The resort\\nhotels are newer and better managed and many of the mistakes made elsewhere\\nwere avoided. As a result, we get a very high proportion of return\\nvisitors,' says Mr Thanos Habipis, chairman of the Cretan Hoteliers'\\nFederation.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3397': \"MR Stefanos Manos is fed up with discussing the problems of Athens. The\\nminister of environment and public works, an energetic - some would say\\nimpatient - technocrat, he blames 'endless talking and delays in\\ndecision-making' for the continuing presence of the nefos, the brown\\npollution cloud that hangs over the city in still weather.\\nCar exhaust fumes are the major source of atmospheric pollution in Athens,\\nnow that industrial emissions are more strictly controlled and householders\\nbanned from using heavy diesel oil for heating.\\nLast summer Mr Manos proposed a tax break for Athenians who bought a new car\\nequipped with a catalytic converter, provided that their old model was\\nturned in.\\nLess than six months later, a short space of time by the standards of Greek\\nbureaucracy, the measure was fully in operation. Car buyers, who normally\\npay import tariffs of over 100 per cent on new vehicles, rushed to the\\nshowrooms. Within weeks, the main graveyard for superannuated cars near\\nMount Parnes outside the city was almost overflowing.\\nOver the past decade the number of private cars in Athens has risen from\\n550,000 to 880,000. This was partly the result of government attempts to cut\\npollution levels in the city centre by permitting cars to circulate only on\\nalternate days, according to the final digit of their number-plate.\\nAthenians got around the odd-even driving ban by acquiring a second car. But\\nsince many new purchases were of second-hand vehicles, the city's car fleet\\ngrew visibly older and dirtier. At the beginning of 1990, 40 per cent of\\nprivate cars were more than 10 years old, compared with 15-20 per cent in\\nother European Community capitals.\\n'The incentives are very successful. At the present rate, 30 per cent of the\\nAthens car fleet will be replaced in three years. Then from 1993, only clean\\ncars will be allowed into the city centre,' Mr Manos says.\\nThe next stage of his plan to banish the nefos is to build a network of\\nunderground garages across the city to provide 25,000 new parking spaces by\\n1994. They would be privately operated for 25 years and then turned over to\\nthe Athens municipality.\\n'On any weekday, there are 45,000 cars illegally parked around Athens and 60\\nper cent of the city's road surfaces are taken up by stationary vehicles. If\\nwe get parked cars off the streets, traffic will start flowing faster and\\nthere'll be fewer fumes,' Mr Manos says.\\nThe third stage is to revive a highway project first proposed over 40 years\\nago by building about 50 kilometres of highway across northern Athens to\\nrelieve pressures on central traffic arteries. It will cost about Dr150bn\\n(Dollars 850m) and be operated 'by the constructor as a toll road, a fast\\nhighway where you pay to save time.'\\nMr Manos says he is sticking to 'quite simple projects, because you have so\\nlittle time to make anything happen before people start thinking in terms of\\nthe next election.'\\nThe biggest project of all, a Dr250bn extension of the Athens underground,\\nshould finally get under way by the end of the year. Its start is already\\ntwo years behind schedule because of politically inspired delays and a\\ndispute over contract terms.\\nAn international consortium led by Siemens of Germany is to build two new\\nlines across the city centre, totalling 18 kilometres in length, and nine\\nstations including one beneath Constitution Square. The extension will take\\nsix years to complete and should carry 1bn passengers a year.\",\n",

The Megaro Mousikis, a white marble cube overlooking a\\nmain Athens avenue, has taken almost 40 years to complete, and its\\nGerman-designed acoustics are said to compete with any symphony hall in\\nnorthern Europe.\\nAll the same, last month's opening was a modest affair. Almost nothing was\\ndone to mark the occasion. The Moscow Soloists, a chamber-sized ensemble led\\nby Yuri Bashmet, a viola player, launched into Bach's Brandenburg Concerto\\nNo. 6 without a trace of inauguration night nerves.\\nIt was the audience who looked awed, as much by the surroundings as the\\nmusic. Until now, concert-going in Greece has required stoic dedication. It\\nusually means perching in the precipitous tiers of an ancient theatre on a\\nhot summer night with someone's knees pressing into the small of your back.\\nMoonlight and history do not necessarily compensate for the thin quality of\\nsound wafted from far below.\\n'Modern Athens never had a roof for the arts. This is what the Megaro will\\nprovide,' says Mr Christos Lambrakis, the owner of Greece's largest\\nnewspaper group. As chairman of the Friends of Music, which persuaded the\\nstate to provide a site for the Megaro but repeatedly ran out of funds for\\nconstruction, he convinced the former socialist government to come up with\\nmost of the Dr19bn (Dollars 10.5m) needed to complete the project.\\nMusic is one of the areas where Greek cultural tradition has kept its\\ndistance from the west. Folk music followed eastern rhythms; in cities the\\nequally oriental sound of the bouzouki held sway.\\nThe bouzouki used to be inextricably linked with rebetika, harsh songs about\\ndrugs and violence in the Greek underworld. It was made respectable by\\ncomposers Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hadjidakis, whose scores for the films\\n'Zorba the Greek' and 'Never on Sunday' brought a softened version of\\nrebetika to a much bigger audience.\\nYet Greece occasionally produced classical musicians of the stature of Maria\\nCallas or Dimitri Mitropoulos, the conductor, who became household names\\nlike the bouzouki singers. In recent years classical music has gained ground\\nrapidly, helped by the success of a new generation of performers with an\\ninternational reputation.\\nBut would the potential Greek audience be large enough to support a concert\\nhall seating 2,000? Mr Lambrakis suspected not, so the Megaro was redesigned\\nas a multi-purpose building when work on its concrete skeleton resumed in\\n1986 after a seven-year gap.\\n'Greece is obviously not the kind of country that can provide large\\nsubsidies for the arts. We have to try to ensure that we can pay our way,'\\nhe says.\\nThe original design by a German architect, Heinrich Keilholz, was radically\\noverhauled to provide additional facilities for staging opera and theatre\\nand to accommodate advances in acoustic technology. The acoustics were\\ndesigned by Prof Helmut Muller, whose research was used in construction of\\nthe Opera de la Bastille in Paris.\\n'It would have been too expensive to demolish the concrete shell, so we had\\nto work within the constraints of the original frame of a building which had\\na much less ambitious purpose. This presented a great challenge to the civil\\nengineers,' says Mr Rolf Krogmeyer, an architect who worked on the Megaro at\\nthe start of his career and found himself unexpectedly recalled years later.\\nThe result is a hexagonal shaped hall with tiered boxes rising from both\\nsides of the stage. Behind the stage is a huge organ, concealed by a wooden\\nscreen. The organ is a gift from Siemens and the Greek and German\\ngovernments.\\nThe suspended ceiling, panelled in American red oak, can be set in four\\nseparate positions to accommodate the variations in sound reflection that\\nare needed for the full enjoyment of different kinds of performance: opera,\\ntheatre, chamber and symphony music.\\n'Nowadays, acoustics dictate the shape of a concert hall. To achieve clarity\\nof speech you must be able to shrink the space but for the sound of a\\nsymphony orchestra to be appreciated, it must be enlarged again,' Mr\\nKrogmeyer says.\\nFor theatre and opera, two towers rise from the basement and a lighting grid\\ndescends to form a conventional proscenium arch. The front of the apron\\nstage drops away to make room for an orchestra pit.\\nThe basement contains an asymmetrical chamber music hall, not yet finished,\\nwhich will seat an audience of 500. Beside it is a self-contained recording\\nstudio with thick concrete walls set on steel springs to eliminate\\nvibrations from passing traffic.\\nThe main hall is also equipped to serve as a conference centre with\\ntranslation booths for 10 languages. 'It's designed so that you can hold a\\ncongress into the afternoon and then be able to set up for a concert in the\\nspace of three hours,' Mr Lambrakis says.\\nLooking further ahead, the aim is to encourage young Athenians to become\\nregular concert-goers. As a start, Mr Lambrakis intends to fit the courtyard\\noutside the Megaro with a giant screen for simultaneous projection of\\nperformances going on inside. 'There would be no entrance charge.

The public sector also has a dominant role in\\nmanufacturing though that is less visible, since many larger companies are\\ncontrolled indirectly through the state-owned banks. Others belong to the\\nIndustrial Reconstruction Organisation, a state umbrella for a group of\\ndebt-burdened companies nationalised in the early 1980s by the former\\nsocialist government.\\nWhile the socialists were held responsible for weakening Greek industry\\nthrough selective nationalisations in sectors they considered strategic, the\\nseeds of today's crippling deficits were undoubtedly sown by the statist\\npolicies of their right-wing predecessors.\\nHowever, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis is determined to reverse past attitudes.\\nThe prime minister himself supervises a wide-ranging privatisation programme\\nlaunched immediately the conservatives came to power last April.\\nThe companies to be privatised form a profile of Greek industry: among them\\nare shipyards, mineral processing units, a textile group, several paper\\nmills, a leading construction company and a group of co-operative dairies\\nthat belong to the Agricultural Bank.\\nThe original aim was to dispose of the 20-odd companies controlled by the\\nIRO as quickly as possible and encourage the banks to shed another 70\\ncompanies. As a parallel measure, legislation was passed permitting the sale\\nof up to 49 per cent of public sector corporations through the Athens Stock\\nExchange.\\nTo co-ordinate the process, the government issued official guidelines for\\nhandling sales and appointed NM Rothschild, the British merchant banker, as\\nits privatisation consultant.\\nBut the timetable has slipped badly and it now seems unlikely that this\\nyear's budget forecast of Dr200bn (Dollars 1.2bn) in privatisation revenues\\nwill be met. Only two small IRO companies have been disposed of, a\\nyachtbuilder and a plastics manufacturer. One partial privatisation has\\ntaken place with the sale of a 49 per cent stake in Olympic Airways'\\ncatering subsidiary to Abela, an international industrial caterer.\\nValuations and appointments of financial advisers took longer than expected,\\nwhile potential buyers were fewer than anticipated given the surge in\\nacquisitions of Greek manufacturing units by both local and foreign\\ncompanies over the past two years.\\nMr Yiannis Piperoglou, an independent consultant serving as secretary to the\\ngovernment's privatisation committee, says: 'When we started, I was looking\\nforward to putting some deals together.

Last year the IRO companies' losses\\ntotalled Dr45bn and their accumulated debts reached Dr215bn.\\nMr Mitsotakis remains adamant that the IRO must shut down at the end of the\\nyear. This means in effect that a number of companies will be have to\\nliquidated since the IRO will be unable to continue its current practice of\\nextending deadlines in the hope of attracting better offers.\\nFurther delays may be caused by a European Court of Justice decision in a\\ncase brought by the former owner of an IRO company. The court is expected to\\nrule that the socialists' method of nationalisation, through a compulsory\\nincrease of share capital, flouted Community directives on company law\\nbecause shareholders were not consulted.\\nSuch a ruling could bring a spate of lawsuits against the IRO as other\\nformer owners see a chance to recover control of their companies, or at\\nleast to demand compensation from the government.\\nAt the same time, Greek officials are having to stay in close touch with the\\nEuropean Commission to make sure that terms of sale for larger industrial\\ncompanies, such as the heavily subsidised shipyards, do not run foul of\\ndirectives on fair competition.\\nMuch attention is being focused on the upcoming sale of Heracles General\\nCement, by far the best buy among the IRO's holdings and one of the few\\ncompanies slated for privatisation that has posted operating profits in\\nrecent years.\\nWhile Heracles was being valued, the statist faction in the government\\nargued in favour of keeping it in the public sector. The company was\\nnationalised in 1983 with a capitalisation of debts totalling Dr27bn. The\\nmove later allowed the IRO to gain control of 70 per cent of its shares.\\nEven before the government committed itself to selling Heracles, the\\nCommission had decided that this method of writing off debt violated\\ncompetition rules.\\nDespite the legal complications, there is no shortage of interest in\\nHeracles, said to be Europe's largest single cement exporter, among\\ninternational producers. The company's pre-tax profits totalled Dr11.9bn\\nlast year on Dr41.6bn turnover.\\nThe recent appointment as chairman of Mr Stelios Stavridis, a former\\nHeracles executive who left shortly after its nationalisation, is seen as\\nunderlining the government's intention to speed up its sale.\\n'The company has deteriorated while under state control, but it is still in\\nreasonably sound shape.

It started with a\\ndecision by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, to take on the\\nshipping portfolio himself, a move seen by the community as long overdue\\nrecognition for its contribution to the economy, as major employers and\\nearners of foreign exchange.\\nDay-to-day running of the Merchant Marine Ministry was left to Mr Aristotle\\nPavlides, who eventually took over as minister six months later. By that\\ntime, the prime minister's promise to address the shipping industry's\\nproblems with 'imagination and daring' had resulted in new measures intended\\nto boost the competitiveness of Greek flag vessels in the international\\nmarket.\\nTonnage tax on vessels of 80,000 gross tons was slashed by 75 per cent,\\nwhile ships from 40,000 to 80,000 gt were granted a 50 per cent reduction.\\nAn extension of the tax breaks to smaller vessels is now under consideration\\nby the ministry.\\nThe crew reductions removed up to five members from the complements required\\non Greek flag vessels. To counter the outcry from seafarers' unions, Mr\\nPavlides made it clear that this was mainly a paper exercise to normalise a\\nsituation in which companies applied individually to use reduced\\n'experimental' crews.\\nThe government has also acted on shipowners' long- standing complaints about\\nthe dismal state of telecommunications in Piraeus. Efforts by the Greek PTT\\nto upgrade the system include a pilot project giving the port priority. By\\nJune an extra 17,000 lines should become available, together with other\\nimprovements.\\nMaritime education, another nagging problem in the eyes of owners, is also\\nbeing tackled. Some training schools that were expensive to maintain and not\\nfully used have been closed. Now the British sandwich-course training system\\nis being adopted and the ministry is consulting owners on further reforms to\\nbe implemented in the 1991-92 academic year.\\nThough the government's moves were favourably received by the shipping\\ncommunity, the number of vessels attracted to the national flag has remained\\nrelatively small. This is largely because of factors over which the\\ngovernment has little control.\\nJust as the tax and crew cuts were announced, a wave of strikes paralysed\\nbanks, communications and power supplies for a three-week period. The\\nwalk-outs underlined all too clearly the kind of problems that owners had\\nbeen pointing out for years. Piraeus shipping offices were forced to\\nrelocate staff abroad temporarily, to keep in contact with their vessels.\\nIn addition, a weak freight market and an uncertain outlook worldwide\\nfollowing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were more than enough to induce\\nhesitation about changing office location or flag.\\nNonetheless, figures have improved. At the end of 1990, the Greek flag fleet\\nstood at 2,031 vessels totalling 22.53m gross tons, compared with 2,003\\nvessels of 21m gt at the end of December 1989.\\nForeign exchange earnings from shipping soared by 29.3 per cent over the\\nsame period to Dollars 1.79bn, the highest total since a 1981 peak of\\nDollars 1.82bn. The trend continued in January this year with earnings\\nincreasing by 21.1 per cent to Dollars 139m, against Dollars 111.5m in the\\nsame month last year.\\nThe fleet's accident record also improved, with incidents involving Greek\\nships falling in 1990 to 54 from 58 the previous year. However, 51 lives\\nwere lost compared with only nine in 1989, principally because of two\\ndisasters.\\nMr Pavlides stresses the need to rebuild a climate of trust between owners,\\nseafarers and the government. Unquestionably, the government's efforts have\\nmade a difference. But Greek owners will continue to be market-oriented on\\nthe whole. Unless it makes sound business sense, they will not opt for the\\nhome flag or a Piraeus office.\\nStill, one indication of a revised perception of the situation in Greece\\ncame with the announcement by the London-based Papachristides Ship\\nManagement Services that it would transfer its ship management operation to\\nPiraeus this spring.\\nThe shipowners' associations continue to emphasise their stated aim of\\nattracting new shipping and financial activities to Piraeus. But Greek\\nowners, individualists to the last, always look at the bottom line where\\ntheir own business is concerned.\\nOne of the major issues, especially for smaller owners, is fleet\\nreplacement. By the end of 1990 Piraeus banks were offering new types of\\nfacilities to clients such as standby lines of credit for future vessel\\npurchases.\\nAs ship values dropped in the second half of the year, Greek owners, with\\ntheir traditional knack for spotting a good buy, began to inspect vessels\\nwith a view to purchasing. The Gulf war put a temporary brake on plans, but\\nsince late February, owners have come strongly into the second-hand market\\nagain, showing interest in a wide range of vessels.\\nAt the same time, two Piraeus-based companies have revealed new building\\norders for products carriers. One, Eletson Corporation, is already the\\nlargest dedicated products shipping company in the world. The other, Forum\\nMaritime, is only now preparing to enter the wet trades.\\nBoth new building contracts are for modern, highly sophisticated tonnage in\\nline with standards required for trading with the US.

Labour problems are a common occurrence.\\nFor the customer, even the simplest transaction can take a great deal of\\ntime as tellers wrestle with telephones that don't work and piles of\\npaperwork.\\nMr Panagis Vourloumis is the managing director of Alpha Finance, 'the\\nclosest thing to a merchant bank in Greece', as he puts it.\\n'Our communications technology is years out of date. People cannot get in\\ntouch with us so we lose business,' Mr Vourloumis says.\\nHe feels that if there is not substantial investment and reform in the\\nbanking sector soon, Greece risks being left behind not only by the more\\nadvanced countries in the European Community but also by Spain and Portugal\\nwhich are already putting into place new banking systems. He believes that\\nGreece has expertise in many areas and could develop a proper financial\\nservices industry.\\n'At the moment financial services are only an appendage of the banks. But\\nthey could develop independently, for instance if offering banking expertise\\nand services to countries like Bulgaria and Romania - places where Greek\\nbanks, more than the more developed institutions in Germany or the UK, have\\na knowledge and feel for the way business is done.'\\nAlpha Finance has been approached by various east European countries but, Mr\\nVourloumis says, it already has more than enough business in the home\\nmarket. 'Even with our communications problems, we can compete with the\\nforeign banks.'\\nSet up two years ago, Alpha Finance belongs to a group of financial services\\ncompanies founded by Credit Bank, Greece's largest private bank, which\\ninclude stockbroking, leasing, insurance and financial information services.\\nCredit Bank is the largest shareholder. Samuel Montagu also has a small\\nstake, with the rest of the institution's equity held by employees - an\\ninnovation in the Greek banking sector.\\nIn the past two years, with a dramatic rise in business on the Athens Stock\\nExchange, Alpha Finance has been closely involved in helping several\\ncompanies go public.\\nTogether with Credit Bank, it launched two mutual funds, a diversified\\nequity and a fixed income fund, the first of its kind in Greece. The two\\nfunds manage more than Dr20bn (Dollars 110m) in assets.\\nAlpha Finance is also involved in the government's privatisation process,\\ncarrying out valuations and acting as financial adviser on the sale of\\nseveral companies.\\n'Privatisation is a revolution in Greece. If it's successful, and for the\\nfuture of the country it has to be, then the whole economic outlook will\\nchange,' Mr Vourloumis says.\\nHe points out that as the recession bites deeper, 'some foreign institutions\\nhave come to pick the crumbs from the Greek table - something we welcome\\nbecause it broadens the market.'\\nBut Mr Vourloumis and other bankers accept that Greece is still viewed as a\\nbureaucratic nightmare for some foreign institutions.\\nWhile profit repatriation is permitted, bureaucratic stipulations result in\\ntortuous hold-ups. A combination of labour problems and telecommunications\\ndifficulties has held up progress on automated banking. Cheques are almost\\nas rare as a free taxi in the Athens rush hour. The black economy encourages\\ncash transactions. It is not uncommon to see customers carrying briefcases\\nbulging with drachma in and out of banks.\\n'Setting up Alpha Finance was an expression of our faith in the future,'\\nsays Mr Vourloumis. 'I am an optimist - things are going to change.'\",\n",

Stringent\\nconditions were attached before the first tranche of Ecu1bn was paid.\\nIf Greece is to participate in the next phase of European monetary union, it\\nmust meet ambitious targets for reducing a chronically high inflation rate\\nand public sector borrowing requirement in the next three years.\\nMr Efthymios Christodoulou, the economy minister, says: 'It's a basic\\nchoice. Either you follow the other 11 (EC members) and make an effort to\\nsubmit to painful measures, or you stay on the periphery and see what\\nhappens.'\\nTo ensure the drachma can enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS by\\nthe end of 1993, inflation must come down to 9.5 per cent that year, from\\n22.8 per cent in 1990. This year's target is 17.5 per cent.\\nCentral administration borrowing, which totalled 13.1 per cent of GNP last\\nyear, is expected to shrink to 10.5 per cent this year and reach a minimal\\n1.5 per cent in 1993.\\nThe current account deficit must be limited to 3 per cent of GNP, compared\\nwith an average of over 4 per cent for the past two years.\\nOther conditions call for the kind of reforms that Greek economic analysts\\nhave advocated for years but governments were always reluctant to apply\\nbecause of the political cost.\\nThey include a 10 per cent cut in civil service staffing levels by 1993, a\\nbroadening of the tax base to include more farmers and an effective\\ncrackdown on tax evasion by restructuring revenue collection.\\nSuch strict conditionality is the result of the former socialist\\ngovernment's failure to keep the terms of an Ecu1.5bn Community loan in the\\nmid-1980s.\\nStructural reform was largely ignored but the government managed to cut the\\nPSBR from 18 to 13 per cent of GDP and bring inflation down from 22 to 12\\nper cent before yielding to pressure for substantial wage increases.\\nThese, together with an extravagant campaign to find public sector jobs for\\nsocialist supporters in the run-up to the June 1989 election, quickly\\ndissipated the gains from two years of tight austerity.\\nCrucial economic decisions were postponed during almost a year of political\\nstalemate before the conservatives' narrow election victory last spring. Now\\nthe government cannot afford any delay at all in implementing reforms if it\\nwants to benefit from a recovery forecast for 1993. By that time, another\\nelection will be imminent.\\nOne encouraging sign has been union willingness to accept pay rises well\\nbelow the inflation rate, following the abolition of automatic index-linking\\nof wages at the end of 1990. This year public sector employees will receive\\nnominal increases of 8 per cent.\\nIn the private sector, a landmark agreement was struck that seems to\\nguarantee smooth labour relations for the next two years. The unions agreed\\nto a basic 12 per cent increase for this year and 9 per cent in 1992, when\\ninflation of 14 per cent is forecast.\\nIn fact, inflation could drop below 17 per cent this year. 'Underlying\\ninflation, especially labour costs, is below the consumer price index, and\\nthis year's target was set when the outlook for oil prices was much\\ngloomier,' said one analyst.\\nGrowth this year will be restricted to less than 1 per cent, but even that\\nwould be an improvement. Revised estimates for 1990 show negative growth of\\nminus 0.4 per cent, largely as a result of a sharp drop in agricultural\\nproduction after a disastrous drought.\\nThe main challenge for the government is to meet its budget targets for\\ncurbing public sector expenditure and increasing revenues.\\nThere has been little sign so far that the deficit-plagued public sector\\nenterprises have reined in spending, though a new scheme requiring them to\\nsubmit monthly accounts to the Economy Ministry should impose more\\ndiscipline.\\nAbout 35 per cent of budget revenues are already earmarked for serving the\\npublic debt. Even if the stabilisation programme meets all its targets,\\noverall debt will still total more than 90 per cent of GDP in 1993.\\nOn the revenue side, the Finance Ministry is confident of maintaining last\\nyear's growth in tax income of more than 30 per cent. But tax evasion\\ndeprived the government of Dr350bn in revenues last year (Dollars 1.9bn),\\nequivalent to about 3 per cent of GDP.\\nMr Yiannis Palaiocrassas, the finance minister, says: 'Much of the present\\nevil in the tax system stems from apparently contradictory provisions and\\nregulations that make it hard to determine when an enterprise is outside the\\nlaw. But it's true there is a lot of corruption everywhere.'\\nThe black economy, estimated at 30-40 per cent of GDP, is under attack.\\nBuoyed by the success of its raids on night clubs and restaurants, the\\nministry is setting up a 'tax commando unit' to frighten more proprietors\\ninto producing correct receipts on their newly installed cash registers.\\nBut the new income tax structure will not come into effect until 1993. In\\nthe meantime, tax returns will be systematically cross-checked this year for\\nthe first time.\\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that the government is unlikely to collect\\nthe expected income from its privatisation programme. The Industrial\\nReconstruction Organisation was expected to sell about 20 companies under\\nits control this year. Due to lack of interest from buyers, it seems that\\nall but half a dozen may have to be liquidated instead.\\nAnother important potential source of revenue, sales of land bonds\\nredeemable as building plots, is lagging behind schedule. If, as seems\\nlikely, they are not introduced until late in the year, it will be hard to\\navoid a revenue shortfall.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3406': \"BANK OF Greece officials are professing confidence that when restrictions on\\nlong-term capital outflows are finally lifted next month, there will be no\\nlarge-scale flight of funds. But if a note of trepidation creeps into their\\nvoices, it is hardly surprising.\\nThe liberalisation, which will bring Greece into line with its European\\nCommunity partners by permitting individual Greek investors to buy property\\nand securities abroad, is already more than a year overdue.\\nSuccessive governments obtained an extension, citing a steadily worsening\\ncurrent account deficit that reached Dollars 3.6bn last year, over 5 per\\ncent of GDP.\\nThe deficit is shrinking only slowly, but a commitment was made to freeing\\noutward capital movement this spring under the terms of the EC emergency\\nbalance of payments loan to Greece.\\nMr Dimitris Chalikias, the governor of the Bank of Greece, belives the\\nbenefits of liberalisation will quickly outweigh any adverse effects on the\\nbalance of payments.\\n'We're not very worried about the effect on the current account deficit. It\\nwon't be so large. The important factor is the confidence it brings, which\\nwill encourage capital inflows as well.'\\nThere are no longer any restrictions on inward capital movement, or on\\ndirect investment abroad. Greek companies are already allowed to borrow from\\nforeign banks, in foreign currency if they wish.\\nBut until last year, total Greek purchases of foreign securities were\\nlimited to Ecu50m (Dollars 60m) yearly in EC and European Investment Bank\\nissues. At present, Greek mutual funds can place no more than 25 per cent of\\ntheir portfolios in foreign stocks.\\nThe average Greek businessman still aspires to owning property in England or\\nSwitzerland and a portfolio of Wall Street stocks, though the flourishing\\nequity and property markets in Athens mean such investments may be as much a\\nstatus symbol as a hedge against the spectre of political or economic\\nturmoil at home.\\nThe Bank of Greece view is that the serious money has already left because\\nwealthy Greeks have little difficulty in bypassing regulations in order to\\ntransfer capital abroad.\\nMr Chalikias says: 'If we consider the structure of foreign exchange\\nreceipts, invisibles are the most important item and private capital inflow\\nis a very large item. This structure makes it relatively easy for capital to\\nbe exported unofficially.'\\nNonetheless, a steady trickle of funds abroad can be expected as smaller\\nGreek investors experiment with purchases of foreign securities or buy\\nsecond homes in parts of western Europe where prices compare favourably with\\nthose in Greece.\\nOn a lesser scale, lifting the current yearly ceiling of Dollars 300 on\\ncredit card purchases abroad, also included in the liberalisation, will add\\nto the outflow.\\nOnce the initial shock is absorbed, 'this move will prove a catalyst for\\nchanging the entire Greek financial landscape,' according to Mr George\\nZavvos, European Parliament member who chairs the recently established\\ncommittee for the reform of the Greek financial system.\\nThe committee's aim is to implement EC policy on banking and securities as\\nswiftly as possible. This involves preparing a considerable amount of new\\nlegislation. While the Bank of Greece has been steadily deregulating the\\nbanking system over the past five years, little has been done to overhaul\\nits legal framework.\\nMr Zavvos, who used to work for the European Commission, should be the ideal\\nperson for the job: he was responsible for drafting the Community's Second\\nBanking Directive.\\n'We have one of the most antiquated banking systems in Europe, so we needed\\na mechanism for change. The image of Greek regulatory institutions needs to\\nbe reformed. Integrity and efficiency are terribly necessary if we are to\\nstart competing with the rest of the Community.'\\nThe committee has already prepared legislative decrees on solvency ratios\\nand capital adequacy arrangements that will bring Greece into line with\\nstandards worldwide. A law is being drafted on banks' accounting plans; a\\nmuch-delayed scheme for guaranteeing deposits is nearly complete.\\nImprovements in prudential supervision are also high on the agenda.\\nTestimony in recent weeks by Mr Chalikias and other Bank of Greece officials\\nat the trial of several former cabinet ministers accused of involvement in a\\nDollars 200m embezzlement scandal at the privately owned Bank of Crete\\nrevealed that, without government support, the central bank was unable to\\nmount an effective investigation of its own.\\nOnce the new legislation is in place, the state-owned Greek banks, which\\nstill control more than 70 per cent of deposits but have largely failed to\\ngrasp the opportunities offered by deregulation, will come under much\\nstronger pressure to modernise, Mr Zavvos says.\\n'The state banks have a competitive advantage in their proximity to the\\nclient plus their networks all over Greece. Their unions are weaker than\\nthey used to be, so there is a chance to improve efficiency. But they need\\nup-to-date technology and management.'\\nFor the 22 foreign banks, the reforms will mean 'a more level playing\\nfield,' according to one foreign manager. Though the foreign banks complain\\nabout the vagueness of existing legislation, it has not deterred them from\\nexpanding their retail banking operations or from becoming the leading\\nplayers in handling mergers and acquisitions.\\nThe revised framework will also reinforce the position of the two leading\\nprivate Greek banks, which between them hold 14 per cent of deposits.\\nBoth have carved out profitable niches, expanding into leasing and brokerage\\nactivities in recent years, while avoiding involvement with the loss-making\\npublic sector corporations.\\n'The private banks have already done well out of deregulation. We're more\\nflexible. It's a question of quality of services. Our bank is modelled on\\nthe kind of helpful high street bank that doesn't exist any more,' says Mr\\nConstantine Capsaskis, chairman of Ergobank, which looks after small\\nbusinessmen and is one of the most profitable banks in Europe.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3407': \"IN THE wealthier parts of Athens, the mink coats come out during the short\\nspells of winter weather. The children of the wealthy - there are plenty of\\nthem - while away their time in coffee bars or parade round the city in\\nexpensive cars. House buyers still carry suitcases full of drachma to\\ncomplete cash purchases for properties which have recently risen to\\nLondon-style prices.\\nAt times it is hard to reconcile life in Greece with the official\\nstatistics: on a wealth per head basis Greece is now the poorest country in\\nthe EC. It also has the worst economic health record in the Community. It\\nhas been saved from financial pneumonia only by emergency treatment from\\nBrussels, in the form of a recently approved Ecu2.2bn loan - granted on the\\nstrictest terms yet imposed on a member state.\\n1990 was the year when the EC finally ran out of patience with Greek\\ngovernments which seemed either unwilling or unable to put the country's\\nfinancial affairs in some sort of order.\\nEarly last year Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,\\nwrote a terse letter to the then 'ecumenical' government. He said the\\ndeteriorating economic situation in Greece threatened the future not only of\\nthe country but also jeopardised future developments within the EC. Greece,\\nsaid Mr Delors, was lagging behind the Community to the point where the EC's\\n'course towards the single market, monetary union and European unification\\nis in danger of being permanently undermined.'\\nGreece's creditworthiness was increasingly at risk due to a rapidly rising\\npublic debt and other imbalances in the economy. 'We think it indispensable\\nthat drastic measures be quickly taken to make clear the country's\\nwillingness to reduce these imbalances for good,' said Mr Delors.\\nThe direct language of the communication broke the delicate protocol the\\nCommission employs in its dealings with sovereign EC governments. The EC was\\nangry that Greece had failed to abide by the terms of a Dollars 1.7bn EC\\nemergency loan made in 1985. The message this time was clear: if Greece did\\nnot put its economy in order, then the country risked being left behind by\\nthe rest of the Community.\\nThe new EC loan - finally approved in February this year - sets the\\nparameters of Greek economic policy for the next three years. The loan is in\\nthree tranches and is set on what the Commission describes as 'strict and\\ncomprehensive' conditions.\\nThese include bringing inflation down from 17 to 7 per cent, cutting central\\ngovernment borrowing from 17 per cent of GDP to 1.5 per cent in the 1990-93\\nperiod, a 10 per cent reduction in public sector employment, curbs on public\\nsector pay rises and a radical broadening of the tax base.\\nThe government is in desperate need of the loan to cover a current account\\ndeficit which totalled Dollars 3.2bn in 1990. The loan is also necessary to\\nensure Greece's continuing creditworthiness as it goes to the market for an\\nestimated Dollars 3.6bn of foreign borrowing this year.\\nMr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Prime Minister, denies that the terms of the\\nloan constitute an infringement of Greek sovereignty. 'What appears to have\\nbeen a set of conditions imposed from outside was in fact our policy,' says\\nMr Mitsotakis. 'We told Brussels to tell us these things. Our economic\\npolicy is a very courageous one and has various political and social risks\\nattached to it. But we are determined to carry out these vital reforms.'\\nSome Greek officials admit that the fact that Brussels is seen to be\\nimposing its terms on the future course of the economy has made life easier\\nfor the government. In the divisive world of Greek politics it would have\\nfound it hard to act alone. There could have been a series of damaging\\nstrikes and social chaos.\\nThere was some disquiet within EC ranks about the loan. Mr Mitsotakis says\\nagreement was reached only after consultations 'at a very high level'. At a\\nmeeting of EC finance ministers in Milan last December it was suggested that\\nGreece should turn to the IMF for help. But Mr Delors and others have argued\\nthat a solution to Greece's problems should be found 'within the family' of\\nthe EC.\\nIf Brussels shows signs of impatience with Athens, then many Greeks also\\nfeel that the rich, well-developed countries of the EC do not have\\nsufficient regard for their country's particular problems - whether they are\\nones of geography, politics or culture. 'We Greeks have been slow to learn\\nthe intricacies of dealing with Brussels and have had difficulty in\\nco-ordinating our policies,' says one official. 'For that we are penalised.'\\nLike other countries on the EC's periphery, Greece feels it must be granted\\nsome special treatment if, in the words of the Brussels bureaucrats, there\\nis to be 'a level playing pitch' between EC members.\\nOn the macroeconomic level, Greece cannot be said to have made the most of\\nthe opportunities offered by its 10-year EC membership. In 1981 Greek per\\ncapita GDP was 58 per cent of the EC average: it is now 51 per cent. Large\\ninflows of EC money in the early 1980s were not used to make the fundamental\\nreadjustments necessary in the economy.\\nRather than modernise the agricultural sector by investing in agribusiness\\nindustries, funds were used to import new cars or buy videos. As happened in\\nseveral other EC member countries, there was no proper supervision of\\nspending. EC monies helped the former socialist government of Mr Andreas\\nPapandreou to carry on the tradition of making political appointments to the\\ncivil service and give electorally beneficial pay rises.\\nMr Costas Simitis was national economy minister during the middle years of\\nthe Papandreou era but resigned in 1987 when the former government, faced\\nwith an election, abandoned its austerity programme. He admits that mistakes\\nhave been made and that as a result Greece only has 'a weak voice' within\\nthe EC. 'The trouble now is that the government does not have any specific\\nplan as to how it will bring about the reforms Brussels is asking for. For\\ninstance, it has no idea about how to levy taxes on farmers,' says Mr\\nSimitis.\\nThere is little talk of the unified market and 1992 in Greece. Ecu7bn of EC\\nstructural funds covering the 1989-93 period may not be fully utilised due\\nto the lack of public and private matching investment. Of more immediate\\nconcern are the implementation of wage agreements and bringing down\\ninflation.\\nGreek attitudes have changed. Greeks are firmly in favour of EC membership,\\neven if many still refer to Europe as 'over there'. 'We must make sacrifices\\nand fight hard to play our full part in Europe,' says a Greek official. 'If\\nwe fail now, we risk being permanently marginalised.'\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3408': \"OPEN THE history books. Dust off the old maps. There is trouble again in the\\nBalkans.\\nThe priorities of Greece's foreign policy have traditionally been Turkey,\\nTurkey again and then the US. Things are changing. Turkey is still top of\\nthe list. But now the Balkans, a l o n g with the European Community, have\\nassumed greater importance.\\nIn recent months foreign policy debate within the EC has been dominated by\\nthe break-up of eastern Europe and the consequences of German unification.\\nBut for Greece, problems in the Balkans are of far more concern.\\n'Our geographical position has always meant that we have special worries\\nabout the Balkans,' says Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Prime Minister. 'Now\\nthe problems in the region are acute.'\\nThere is great concern about the possible break-up of Yugoslavia. Macedonia,\\nperched on Greece's northern borders, might become a break-away republic and\\ntry to pursue what Athens terms as irredentist claims on Greek territory.\\nTurmoil in Yugoslavia would also have serious economic consequences. It\\ncould put in jeopardy Greece's vital road links with the rest of the EC.\\nMr Mitsotakis's government has worked hard to promote good relations with\\nthe new regimes in Bulgaria and Romania. But Greece has been in something of\\na quandary over recent events in Albania.\\nEarlier this year Mr Mitsotakis became the first Greek premier to visit\\nTirana. A breakdown of Stalinist-type controls in Albania has meant a\\npartial opening of frontiers. Greece has suddenly found itself the rather\\nreluctant host to thousands of members of the Greek minority in southern\\nAlbania. Having talked for years about the plight of this group in what is\\nknown in Athens as North Epirus, the government cannot very well turn the\\nrefugees back: Mr Mitsotakis has instead pleaded with them to stay in\\nAlbania and await political changes.\\nBut, as ever, Turkey remains at the centre of Greek foreign policy. 'The\\nproblems between Greece and Turkey are still in the same old rancid state,'\\nsays Mr Thanos Veremis of the Hellenic Foundation for Defence and Foreign\\nPolicy. 'After Mr Papandreou (the former Greek premier) and Mr Ozal (the\\nthen Turkish Prime Minister, now president) met in Davos in 1988 there was\\ntalk of a rapprochement between the two sides, but nothing has come of it,'\\nMr Veremis adds.\\nGreek a r g u m e n t s with Turkey focus on two issues. One is the\\ncontinuing Turkish presence in northern Cyprus, dating from the 1974\\ninvasion. The other concerns various territorial claims - on the delineation\\nof the Aegean continental shelf, the extent of territorial waters and flight\\ncontrols in Aegean air space.\\nWhile the arguments might appear somewhat stale, they still have the\\npotential to erupt into open conflict. As recently as 1987, Greece and\\nTurkey were brought to the brink of war over rival oil exploration claims.\\nSuggestions that Greece has lessened its resolve in any way on the Cyprus\\nquestion are firmly dismissed by Mr Mitsotakis. He draws parallels between\\nrecent events in the Gulf and the Cyprus question. 'I feel now that\\nconditions are better than ever for a settlement. The world reacted strongly\\nto the occupation of Kuwait. There is a foreign occupation in Cyprus. The\\nSecurity Council resolutions on the issue m u s t be i m p l e m e n t e d,'\\nsays Mr Mitsotakis.\\nThis view is unlikely to be echoed in Ankara. There are fears in Greece that\\nTurkish attitudes are hardening. The theory is that Turkish self-confidence\\nhas been bolstered by its role as a vital support base for the allied forces\\nduring the Gulf conflict.\\nMr Antonis Samaras, the Greek foreign minister, has lobbied energetically in\\nwestern capitals to try to ensure that Greek interests are not forgotten. At\\nthe same time, Mr Samaras has sought to reinforce relations with many\\ngovernments in the Middle East.\\nGreek officials admit that foreign policy, with the exception of attitudes\\nto Turkey, has lacked consistency. Mr Papandreou sought to weave a complex\\nset of relationships with the third world, with the countries of the Middle\\nEast and with some of the now disgraced governments of eastern Europe.\\nDuring his term of office, there was much anti-US talk but behind the scenes\\nAthens remained close to Washington.\\nIn the middle of last year Mr Mitsotakis became the first Greek premier to\\nmake an official visit to the US in 27 years. He describes relations now as\\n'excellent'. A new agreement on US bases in Greece has been signed. Out of\\nthe four bases one has already been closed through Pentagon cost-cutting\\nmeasures, while another is due to stop operating later this year.\\nBut there are still some political difficulties between Athens and\\nWashington. Greece was angry about a State Department directive issued\\nduring the Gulf war advising US nationals not to visit Athens.\\nMore broadly, Greece is concerned that a Washington which is now more well-\\ndisposed towards Turkey might try to upset the seven-to-10 ratio in military\\naid given to Greece and Turkey. However, this ratio is more myth than fact -\\nfor some time more US aid has been flowing to Turkey.\\nAmerican officials in Athens say it is clear that the EC is now seen as 'big\\nbrother' in Athens, rather than the US. Greece is among the most ardent\\nintegrationists in the EC. It wants a common defence network and to become a\\nfull member of the Western European Union (WEU). Some officials in Athens\\nsay Turkey has been actively lobbying against the latter move.\\nGreece has been heartened by what it s e e s as increased EC interest in the\\nCyprus question. Luxembourg, the present holder of the EC presidency, has\\nproposed some form of initiative on the issue: however, some EC members\\nclearly do not want the Community to be dragged into what is seen as an\\nargument between Greece and Turkey.\\nLast month Greece again used its veto within the Community to block Ecu600m\\nworth of EC aid to Turkey. The aid had been linked to progress on the Cyprus\\nissue. Greece said that if Turkey were to receive the funds, it would be\\nseen as 'a reward for Turkish intransigence.'\\nAgain, some EC members were unhappy at this development. Greece recognises\\nthat its interests are best served within the EC. But it is also beginning\\nto realise that there are limits to EC patience when it comes to old and\\nseemingly intractable arguments between Athens and Ankara.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3409': \"AT AN age when most politicians are putting the finishing touches to their\\nmemoirs, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the 72-year-old Greek prime minister,\\nhas undertaken the awkward task of making Greece more like other European\\nCommunity countries.\\nTo succeed, he will need all the tenacity acquired during a career in which\\nthe highest office always seemed to remain just beyond his grasp.\\nThough the socialists who ran Greece during the 1980s were mired in scandal\\nand clearly running out of steam, it was only after three elections and\\nalmost a year of political uncertainty that the conservative New Democracy\\nparty managed to scrape a one-seat parliamentary majority last April.\\nMr Mitsotakis' chances of heading a stable government improved soon\\nafterwards when Mr Constantine Karamanlis, the veteran conservative\\nstatesman who led Greece into the European Community a decade ago, was\\nelected president by parliament.\\nMr Karamanlis has no executive powers as president - they were abolished by\\nthe socialists - but as the founder of New Democracy, he wields considerable\\ninfluence in the party, especially among potential contenders for the\\nleadership.\\nHe would almost certainly try to dissuade anyone who felt tempted to lead a\\nparty rebellion aimed at forcing Mr Mitsotakis to retire and provoking a\\nfresh election. But given the magnitude of the country's economic problems\\nand the unpopular choices necessary to solve them, this is not likely to\\nhappen in the near future.\\nNor are the socialists putting up any serious opposition to the government's\\nthree-year stabilisation programme. Indeed, Mr Andreas Papandreou, the\\nformer prime minister, who was a keen advocate of state ownership while in\\noffice, complained recently that the government was dragging its heels over\\nprivatisation.\\nMr Papandreou, also 72 and in uncertain health, has had some ups and downs\\nwith his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) in recent months as would-be\\nsuccessors started manoeuvring for position. There are several strong\\ncandidates but, like their conservative counterparts, they seem prepared to\\nplay a waiting game.\\nIn any case, the start of Mr Papandreou's long-awaited trial, together with\\nthree former cabinet ministers, on charges of involvement in the Dollars\\n200m Bank of Crete embezzlement scandal rallied the party behind him. Mr\\nPapandreou's refusal to take part in the proceedings, which he claims are\\nthe outcome of a political conspiracy against him, have taken much of the\\ndrama out of the case.\\nThe vengeful mood of two summers ago, when the conservatives joined forces\\nwith the communist-led Left Alliance in a short-lived coalition government\\nfor the exclusive purpose of prosecuting Mr Papandreou and his closest\\nassociates, has faded away. Mr Mitsotakis has nothing to gain from reviving\\npast bitterness if he wants to keep austerity on track and at the same time\\nproject an image abroad of responsible leadership.\\nWere it not for a recent shake-up in the Left Alliance, Greek political life\\nwould almost be dull. After a contentious Communist Party congress where he\\nhelped the Stalinist old guard re-establish control, Mr Harilaos Florakis,\\nthe elderly communist leader, finally stepped down. Even more surprising in\\na country with only a handful of female politicians, both Communists and the\\nLeft Alliance elected women leaders who have scarcely turned 40. However,\\ncontinuing internal battles suggest the Alliance is now more likely to split\\nthan to play a more significant role.\\nIn foreign policy, relations with the United States, always unpredictable in\\nthe Papandreou era, have shown a marked improvement. The signing of new\\nagreement for the US military bases, once a focus for acrimonious political\\ndebate, was barely commented on. After contributing a frigate to the\\nmultinational force in the Gulf war, Greece is participating for the first\\ntime in a UN peacekeeping force, on the Iraq-Kuwait border.\\nBut Turkey's increased regional importance following the war is causing\\nconcern, while long-buried Balkan issues have resurfaced amid increasing\\ninstability along Greece's northern borders.\\nCriticism of the government's performance during its first year in office\\ncentres on the sluggish pace of reform. At the political level, Mr\\nMitsotakis had little difficulty in obtaining a special European Community\\nloan to avert an impending balance of payments crisis and also provide some\\nseed money for long-overdue infrastructure projects.\\nBut fulfilling the terms of the EC loan, essential if Greece is to\\nparticipate in the next stage of European economic and monetary union, does\\nnot just mean improving the economic indicators - though this is hard enough\\nafter a decade marked by stagnating industrial output, runaway deficit\\ngrowth and a growing black economy.\\nAs a former economy minister, Mr Mitsotakis knows that cutting civil service\\npayrolls, being less generous with state pensions, broadening the tax base\\nand curbing tax evasion will require a radical overhaul of the public\\nadministration - and of attitudes among its employees.\\nThe price of failure, the government is beginning to fear, could be Greece's\\nrelegation to satellite status within the Community.\\nMr Mitsotakis says: 'We have to apply these policies. I'm prepared to lose\\nthe next election if I have to, but this is the only way forward.'\\nIn fact, the fiercest opposition to change comes from within the\\nconservative party. New Democracy supporters, together with a number of MPs\\nand party officials, feel resentful that their leader is trying to break\\nwith the traditional rousfeti system by which public sector positions, from\\ncleaners to bank governors, were redistributed by the winning party after\\neach election. After eight years in opposition, and with unemployment\\nrising, they want a share of the cake.\\nBut if Greece is to bring the economy in line with single market\\nrequirements, let alone catch up with Portugal and Ireland, old habits will\\nhave to be cast aside. A new class of efficient, non-partisan administrators\\nmust be found.\\nImproving the state education system is crucial: state schools are\\nill-equipped and badly-paid teachers take out their grievances in prolonged\\nstrikes. Last winter high school students around the country staged a\\nthree-week sit-in. The protests flared into disturbingly violent street\\nprotests in Athens after a teacher was killed in a riot.\\nAs a short-term solution, the government is trying to attract younger Greek\\nbankers and economists back from abroad with a fair degree of success. But\\nonly a limited number of talented diaspora Greeks can be expected to put\\ntheir careers on hold for the sake of helping out at home.\\nIt will be much harder, for example, to train several thousand tax\\ninspectors and motivate them to remain honest in a system where superiors\\noften turn a blind eye to corruption.\\nAnd just in the year since the conservatives took over, a new generation of\\nkareklokentavroi, administrators who cling to their jobs at all costs, has\\nsprung up among the temporary managers appointed to oversee the\\nprivatisation programme.\\nStill, Greek businessmen are feeling more cheerful. There is persistent\\ngrumbling about interest rates that hover just below 30 per cent, but the\\nmore efficient companies in the private sector are busy positioning\\nthemselves for an expected surge in growth after 1992. Deregulation of the\\nlabour market, with the introduction of flexible hours and part-time work is\\nalso making life easier.\\n'There are problems in co-ordinating policy, between the public sector, the\\nprivate sector and local government for instance. The government lacks\\nmanagement skills. But it's moving in the right direction,' says Mr Stelios\\nArgyros, president of the Federation of Greek Industries.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3410': \"IT SOUNDS like the antithesis of capitalism: in several US states\\nelectricity supply companies can now raise their profits by persuading\\ncustomers not to buy their product.\\nThe move is part of an energy conservation effort that underlines the severe\\neconomic and environmental pressures facing the US supply industry in an era\\nof increasing competition, rising anti-pollution costs and huge capital\\nspending demands. A combination of all these forces has started to produce a\\nmerger wave in the highly fragmented industry.\\nSince the early 1970s, US electric power utilities have been battered by a\\ncombination of rising costs and increasing regulation on pricing, new plant\\nconstruction and other issues. Many are still paying for the nuclear power\\nplants ordered in the 1970s but then, abandoned or not, built on time or to\\ncost. According to the Edison Electric Institute, an industry body, the\\ncompanies are producing an average return on equity of about 10 per cent,\\ncompared with the 13 per cent that state regulatory commissions usually\\nallow.\\nForemost among the new challenges facing them now is the cost of complying\\nwith last year's Clean Air Act which mandates that sulphur dioxide\\nemissions, a key component of acid rain, be reduced at coal-fired power\\nstations by about half by the end of the decade.\\nUtilities make some 60 per cent of their power from coal and they have two\\nchoices in complying with the legislation. They can switch from burning\\nsoft, high sulphur coal to hard coal, but this will push up transport costs.\\nAlternatively, they can install expensive flue gas desulphurisation systems,\\notherwise known as scrubbers, or experiment with newer technologies such as\\nfluidised bed combustion. The Edison Institute says that meeting the demands\\nof the act will cost the industry up to Dollars 105bn (Pounds 58.60bn) by\\n2010.\\nIn addition to modifying old plant, the industry is going to have to build\\nmuch new capacity over the next 10 to 20 years to replace old plant and meet\\nnew demand. It is expected to add more than 90,000 net megawatts of new\\ncapacity by the end of the 1990s.\\nSeveral factors have made the business climate more helpful to non-utility\\ncompanies which wish to generate power. The Bush administration, keen to\\nfoster competition in the wholesale power market, has proposed in its\\nrecently unveiled energy strategy to remove 55-year-old restrictions on\\ncompanies owning independent power stations.\\nThe Public Utility Holding Act of 1935 has kept industrial companies out of\\nthe power business and prevented utilities from building generating plant\\noutside their territories and then selling that power on the open market.\\nOther groups have been free to jump into this market: the Public Utility\\nRegulatory Policy Act of 1978 opened the door for small producers of\\nalternative energy to sell power on the open market.\\nRepeal of the 1935 law has stirred up controversy within the utility\\nindustry, with some wanting the freedom to build stations around the country\\nand others unhappy at the presence of independents in their areas.\\nFederal regulators also want changes in control of utilities' transmission\\nlines. At present, while the utilities are required by law to buy power from\\nindependents, they control the electricity after that.\\nThe regulators would like to allow the independents to find their own\\ncustomers. That has brought howls of outrage from the industry, which argues\\nthat the interlopers will simply steal their best clients.\\nAll these factors are forcing some radical changes on the industry. The more\\nfar-sighted utilities have been slashing costs and many have set up their\\nown independent power ventures. They have also turned to management of the\\ndemand side through energy saving, prompted by changes in the regulatory\\nclimate: regulators have begun to offer the companies a return on their\\nenergy savings outlays which is broadly the same as the investment they have\\nbeen making in power plants.\\nThe rule changes - instituted in states such as Massachusetts, New York and\\nCalifornia - have turned conservation from a costly chore for the utilities\\ninto some of their most profitable operations. The so-called 'megawatt'\\nbusiness involves handing out to customers efficient new equipment and\\nsharing in the savings by charging higher rates. The trend has brought\\ntogether some unusual bedfellows, with conservationists pleased that this\\nmeans less power station construction and utilities pleased that they are\\nspared the capital costs of new facilities.\\nThe new competitive pressures are forcing the utilities to consider the\\nonce-outrageous suggestion that they should get together in mergers. There\\nhas been a rash of bids over the past year, including the industry's first\\nimportant hostile offer, when Kansas City Power & Light made a run at\\nneighbouring Kansas Gas and Electric. Behind the merger wave lies a drive\\nfor greater efficiency. Mr Edward Tirello, an analyst at Smith, Barney\\nHarris Upham, and a long-time merger advocate, estimates that about Dollars\\n3.6bn of annual cost savings for the industry could be generated through\\nmore economic and efficient operation of plant.\\nThe largest economies from consolidation would come from pooling - the\\nability to use a more economic generating plant mix in the consolidated\\nservice area during periods of low demand.\\nThe long hand of the regulators could slow down this movement. Only last\\nmonth officials of the California Public Utilities Commission dealt a heavy,\\nthough not yet fatal, blow to the 1988 proposed merger of South California\\nEdison and San Diego Gas and Electric, which would create the largest\\nutility in the nation. The officials agreed that the deal would provide\\nabout Dollars 1bn of benefits to customers but complained that its\\nanti-competitive impact outweighed this.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3411': \"SOME 20 per cent of the UK's energy bill could be saved by investing in\\n'cost-effective energy efficiency measures', according to Mr William\\nRickett, director-general of the UK Energy Efficiency Office.\\nThe scope for reducing energy use is not in doubt. Nor is the need to do it.\\nCarbon dioxide (CO), the main 'greenhouse' gas causing global warming, can\\nonly be tackled by reducing energy consumption. Rather than meeting\\nincreasing energy demand with increasing supply, existing supplies must be\\nused more efficiently. Demand for change will focus on the electricity\\nindustry, an important contributor to CO emissions.\\nThe UK has radically re-structured its electricity industry over the past\\ntwo years in preparation for the private sector. The restructuring arguably\\noffered a unique opportunity to incorporate incentives for energy efficiency\\ninto the licences and the regulation of the new companies. The opportunity\\nwas not taken.\\nUnder the system in England and Wales, it is in everyone's interests to sell\\nelectricity, and in no one's to save. The profits of the generators depend\\non maintaining their market share. The profits of the 12 regional\\nelectricity companies (RECs) depend on the amount of electricity they\\ndistribute and sell. The duty to 'promote', not enforce, energy efficiency\\nlies with the regulator, Professor Littlechild. So far this regulation\\nconsists of ensuring the RECs provide their customers with adequate\\ninformation on ways to cut consumption.\\nWhat privatisation may do is open up the generation side of the market for\\nnew, more efficient technologies. Nearly all of the plant being built or\\nproposed today is based on combined cycle gas-fired turbines (CCGT) which\\nachieve greater efficiency levels than conventional coal-fired plant. It has\\nalso raised the profile of combined heat and power (CHP), which has\\npotential efficiency levels of more than 80 per cent.\\nCritics point out that by splitting generation and distribution, and by the\\nregulatory formula used, the government has removed the potential to\\nintroduce measures to curb demand, such as least-cost planning. This\\ninvolves a utility considering whether improving the end-use efficiency of\\nits customers is more cost-effective than building new generating plant.\\nLeast-cost planning is being 'aggressively pursued' in about 20 US states,\\naccording to Mr Mike Foley of the US National Association of Regulatory\\nUtility Commissioners (NARUC). Some state regulators require utilities to\\nexplore both demand and supply-side options before licensing new capacity.\\nIn most cases, utilities are then allowed to claim back a rate of return on\\ntheir investments in energy efficiency.\\nThe employment of demand-side management is due to be expanded as part of\\nthe new US National Energy Strategy (NES). Although the power industry at\\nfirst resisted this approach, many utilities are now finding it profitable.\\nThese include New England Electric, Boston Edison and Pacific Gas and\\nElectric, three large, privately-owned utilities.\\nAccording to Mr Mike Monahan of Boston Edison, such demand-side management\\nis Edison's main focus because at 'the bottom line it is more cost-effective\\nto buy back electricity than it is to build new generating plant'. Boston\\nEdison will spend Dollars 250m (Pounds 139.6m) to 1995 on energy\\nconservation measures for its customers, including distributing compact\\nfluorescent lightbulbs, and offering free energy audits. In this way, it\\nshaved some 130MW off its peak demand growth in 1990; by 2000, it expects\\nthe figure to be closer to 300MW-400MW.\\nOne of the reasons this strategy works is that most US utilities are\\nvertically integrated and have a mandate to serve a particular area. They\\ntherefore have an incentive to cut demand. The UK RECs, on the other hand,\\nare distributors and suppliers whose franchise market is due to disappear\\nover the next eight years. An attempt by the House of Lords to enable the\\nregulator, under the Electricity Bill, to enforce energy efficiency measures\\nbefore approving tariff increases was overturned in the Commons.\\nThe structure of the European electricity supply industry is diverse, and\\nconsequently the potential for least-cost planning patchy. Swedish\\nstate-owned utility Vattenfall believes it could cut 12TWh-19TWh out of a\\ncommercial and residential demand of 70TWh a year. The next phase, due this\\nautumn, is to discover how much of this potential can be realised.\\nAccording to Mr Morgan Andersson, project manager, the recent decision by\\nthe Swedish government to delay the phase-out of nuclear power means that\\n'it is still vital to keep conservation measures going, but the commercial\\nincentive has changed'. Vattenfall now has no need for new generation until\\n2000.\\nOther Swedish utilities, notably Stockholm Energi, and some German utilities\\nhave implemented demand-side management measures. Italy's state-owned\\nutility ENEL is a vertically-integrated monopoly supplier faced with growing\\ndemand and increasingly unable to site new plant due to environmental\\nopposition. It has started to look at how to cut domestic demand by working\\nwith manufacturers to promote more efficient electrical appliances.\\nA recent study for the UK Energy Department by the March Consulting Group\\nestimates that in the UK alone, replacing appliances with the best available\\non the world market could save 24,000GWh of electricity.\\nThe MCG report, along with the recently released Energy Select Committee\\nreport on energy efficiency, comes to the now familiar conclusion that\\nimprovements are unlikely to happen without government intervention. Schemes\\nto label appliances according to their efficiency have been introduced by\\nFrance, Denmark, and Germany with varying degrees of success, but no\\nEuropean country has implemented labelling fully.\\nAgain, the US record is impressive, with the 1987 National Appliance Energy\\nConservation Act setting minimum standards for domestic appliances. The\\nrecent NES is set to expand this. A number of US utilities also offer\\ncustomer rebates for buying efficient electrical appliances.\\nMeanwhile it may be left to international legislative moves to take energy\\nefficiency to the top of the agenda. Movement may be slow, but environmental\\nlegislation is set to grow increasingly stringent. The European Commission\\nhas already issued a directive setting standards for SOx and NOx emissions\\nfrom power plants.\\nAn EC draft directive calls for compulsory labelling for most domestic\\nappliances in member states from July 1992. Minimum standards are set to\\nfollow.\\nFuture pressure from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climatic Change to cut\\nglobal CO emissions may force utilities and governments to try a little\\nharder.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3412': \"CAUGHT BETWEEN surging demand for electricity and the government's\\ncommitment to environmental protection, Japan's electric power producers and\\nthe ministry that rules them can see only one panacea: nuclear power.\\nJapan lacks energy resources, so nuclear power generation is vital because\\notherwise the nation depends on foreign sources and is vulnerable to\\nunpredictable fuel costs.\\nIn late February, in Niigata prefecture, the No 2 reactor of Tokyo's\\nregional electric power supplier was shut for six days and restarted at the\\nend of the month after an accident attributed to human failure.\\nEarlier that month, a nasty contretemps at the Mihama Nuclear Power Plant\\noccurred when the day after a minor accident at the plant, local residents\\nreceived leaflets from the power company declaring the facility\\naccident-proof. While neither incident seems to have caused injuries or\\ncontamination outside the plant itself, they may help to revive the agendas\\nof anti-nuclear groups.\\nIt has been nearly five years since the Ministry of International Trade and\\nIndustry (Miti) began reducing power companies' rates, to pass to consumers\\nthe benefits of soaring profits ushered in by the strong yen and cheap oil\\nprices. But then the price of oil went up. In the year ending March 31 1990,\\npre-tax profits at Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) fell to Y185bn\\n(Pounds 770.83m) from the previous year's Y275bn-plus, a far cry from 1987,\\nwhen the company raked in more than Y444bn. Pre-tax profits for the year\\nending March 31 are estimated at a dismal Y95bn.\\nAdd to that the likelihood that the government will slap a tax on petroleum\\nproducts to cover around 10 per cent of the Dollars 9bn to be provided in\\nsupport of the allied forces campaign in the Gulf, and things could get even\\nworse. An industry report from Jardine Fleming Securities in late January\\nsaid: 'Doubling the tax rate could plunge EP (electric power) companies into\\nthe red and necessitate a rate hike.'\\nRate negotiations between the government and the companies occur annually.\\nAn increase could be approved this spring, depending on the direction of\\ninterest rates and oil prices, the report added.\\nAccording to Tepco, the company can still make 'reasonable profits' without\\na rate increase, thanks to Japan's continuing economic expansion and\\nenormous demand from the Tokyo region. Underscoring its long-term resilience\\nare the triple-A ratings assigned to the company's outstanding foreign and\\ndomestic bonds (total: around Dollars 11bn), and the high rating of its\\nY300bn in commercial paper.\\nThe Jardine Fleming report noted Tepco's high 71.5 per cent ratio of\\ninterest-bearing debt to capitalisation, but added that 'interest rate\\nmovements cannot justify all the changes over time in EP company\\nprofitability'.\\nTepco says it will 'overcome' and 'survive' the risks ahead. The company is\\nreducing dependence on oil, while capital outlays for nuclear power plant\\nconstruction since the 1970s are claimed to have made it less vulnerable to\\nfossil fuel price vagaries.\\nThe biggest private sector electric power concern in the world, Tepco is one\\nof nine Japanese regional publicly-held electric power companies which\\ntogether produced almost 75 per cent of the country's 798,756m kWh of total\\nelectric power output in 1989-90.\\nAll the regional power companies are dealing with intensifying competition\\nby diversification into such fields as heat supply services,\\ntelecommunications and urban development.\\nTepco used nuclear fuel sources for nearly 30 per cent of its total\\ngeneration (205bn kWh) in 1989. The company relied on LNG-based generation\\nfor 36 per cent of output, while oil dependence was 28 per cent. In the\\nelectric power industry as a whole, nuclear powered electricity output\\naccounted for around 23 per cent of total electricity generated in Japan in\\n1989.\\nThe government's fixation on nuclear power generation is not new. The\\ncountry revved up its first commercially operated nuclear power station in\\nJuly 1966. The 1970s oil shocks were something of an apocalypse:\\nconstruction started on no fewer than 22 nuclear plants during the 1980s. At\\npresent the country has 38 nuclear power plants with another 13 under\\nconstruction and several more on the drawing board.\\nAlready three other regional electric power companies - Kansai, Kyushu and\\nHokuriku - generate more than 40 per cent of their total outputs from\\nnuclear sources, while Shikoku Electric Power generates 38 per cent from\\nnuclear. The heavy reliance by the regionals on nuclear-sourced power has\\nmade them prime targets for anti-nuclear protesters, who have successfully\\nstalled construction of several new reactors.\\nBy 2010, Miti, which regulates and sets strategy for the power companies,\\nintends to double the number of reactors to 78 and boost nuclear power\\nsupply to 43 per cent of total electric power generation.\\nWhile Miti officials claim the anti-nuclear movement has lost momentum since\\nthe Chernobyl disaster, the ministry is not taking the opposition threat\\nlightly. It plans a nationwide three-year PR project later this year\\ndirected at specific groups, including housewives, teenagers and company\\nemployees.\\nThe ministry's strategy is to target the moderates, instead of reacting\\ndirectly to the anti-nuclear movement. The project includes a personal\\ncomputer-style network that provides information and news on nuclear power\\nin public places and at nuclear plant sites. PC-owners can dial a phone\\nnumber to access the network and the ministry will monitor public opinion\\nthrough questionnaires and by telephone.\\nAs part of its effort, the ministry is also distributing free about half a\\nmillion copies of a glossy, 100-page brochure crammed with pictures,\\ndiagrams and flow charts.\\nIn spite of having to close a reactor at its plant in Fukushima, north of\\nTokyo, for nearly two years after a breakdown in January 1989, Tepco's\\ncurrent nuclear construction schedule has 'no symptom of delay,' the company\\nsays.\\nA shift in Japanese political balance appears to brighten the future of\\nnuclear power generation. The Social Democratic Party of Japan (formerly the\\nSocialist Party), a strong foe of all things nuclear, seems to have\\nsquandered the opportunity it gained in elections last year. Amid its\\ndisarray, the SDPJ looks incapable of mounting public support to counter the\\ngovernment's nuclear power commitment.\\nBut short-term difficulties persist. If this summer is as hot as the last,\\nthe industry could blow a fuse. Last July, Tepco met a record surge in power\\ndemand by reportedly getting a big kilowatt injection from other regionals\\nand by urging consumption restraints to ward off power cuts. Miti says it is\\nboosting needed transfers of AC from one generating plant to another when\\nshortages occur.\\nIn a further effort to take the heat off electric power companies, Miti says\\nit is expanding its policy of offering discounts to big industrial\\nconsumers, such as steel, car and chemicals producers, that agree to cut\\npower use during peak demand times.\\nA recent Credit Suisse industry report said 65.7 per cent of the country's\\ntotal electric power demand (including supplies from independent generators)\\nin 1989 was for commercial and industrial use.\\nThe ministry is also trying to curb residential demand that has rocketed\\nowing to the rapid proliferation of home air conditioners.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3413': \"THE FRENCH state-owned power utility, Electricite de France is striving to\\nbreak away from its past as a relic of central industrial control.\\nThe group's independent-minded managers are acutely conscious that EdF\\nstands out in a world where governments are tending to withdraw from public\\nutilities. They want to change that image, to help EdF advance in the export\\nmarkets it sorely needs.\\nAfter the privatisation and break-up of Britain's electricity industry, EdF\\nis left as the only electricity monopoly in Europe responsible for all of\\nits system, from power generation through to the distribution to customers.\\nIt is this strong central organisation, under the continued control of the\\nIndustry Ministry, which has allowed EdF to pursue a consistent pro-nuclear\\ninvestment policy since France's decision to build its own nuclear energy\\nsource in the wake of the 1973 oil price crisis.\\nThis has left France today more dependent on nuclear power than any country\\nin the world. EdF draws more than 80 per cent of its electricity from its 57\\nreactors, providing the cheapest electrical power of any European Community\\ncountry apart from Denmark, a significant advantage for French industry.\\nYet the French nuclear power programme has been criticised as\\nover-ambitious, having produced a surplus of seven to eight reactors,\\naccording to one official report. It attracts sporadic criticism from\\nFrance's vocal but surprisingly disorganised environmental lobby, although\\nnot enough to cast serious doubt on France's nuclear consensus.\\nFor these and purely technical reasons, EdF does not plan to increase its\\nproportional dependence on this source of energy, say officials.\\nWhile the state has reduced its influence on EdF's decisions, as it has\\nacross France's nationalised industries, the utility's top managers are\\nbeginning to see government control - especially on pricing - as a hindrance\\nto their bid to strengthen EdF as the EC's biggest energy exporter.\\nEdF's cross-border energy sales rose 8 per cent last year to 46.5bn kWh or\\n12 per cent of the total and the group wishes to raise exports to near 20\\nper cent of the total by the end of the decade.\\nAt the same time, the group aims to play a significant part in the\\nreplacement of ageing reactors in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Over\\nthe past two years, EdF has delivered a computerised reactor safety\\nmonitoring system to the Soviet Union and opened negotiations for joint\\nventures to build reactors in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It also looks set\\nto emerge in the next few months as the main foreign company to be allocated\\na stake in eastern Germany's electricity supply industry.\\nThe export drive is partly designed to help mop up EdF's nuclear surplus,\\nbut also to help run down the FFr226.1bn (Pounds 22.3bn) debt load that EdF\\nhas built up as a result of the nuclear programme, and to earn the cash\\nneeded to update some of the older reactors.\\nAlready, the French utility's international ambitions have caused anxiety in\\npolitically influential German coal-producing regions, worried about the\\nthreat of cheap imported nuclear electricity accelerating job losses in the\\nmines. And in Britain, EdF's attempts to sell excess power at advantageous\\nrates to industrial customers in France have attracted competitors'\\nsuspicion.\\nMr Jean Bergougnoux, EdF's managing director, points out that it is hard to\\npersuade EC competition authorities that he is not dumping electricity when\\nhis government runs a pricing policy that squeezes EdF's profits. 'A company\\nlike EdF must have balanced accounts if it is to be perceived as a fair\\ncompetitor,' he says.\\nIn theory, EdF's contract with the Paris government obliges it to hold price\\nrises at 1.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation. Yet in practice,\\nthe government has, until recently, tended to hold rates lower than that,\\nwith the result that EdF has made losses for six out of the past 11 years.\\nThe powerful Finance Ministry argues that cheap power helps curb inflation\\nand so supports the value of the franc, an idea which provokes the derision\\nof Mr Pierre Delaporte, EdF's sometimes outspoken chairman. 'If we were\\nconvinced that the delay in allowing us to raise our tariffs was necessary\\nto keep the franc safe on the international foreign exchange markets, we\\nwould gladly sacrifice on the altar of the fatherland, but we do not believe\\nit for a moment,' he said recently.\\nHowever, in February, EdF received the go-ahead to increase prices by 2.2\\nper cent, as against the 2.8 per cent general inflation rate forecast for\\n1991 - a rise greeted as 'moderate' by Mr Delaporte.\\nCertainly, EdF is gradually beginning to look more like a commercially fair\\ncompetitor than a state monolith. It is now 10 years since it last received\\na subsidy from the government.\\nEdF even managed to produce a profit in 1990, partly thanks to an increase\\nin exports and also reflecting the first fruits of a plan to cut costs by\\nFFr1bn.\\nMr Bergougnoux believes that it is only a matter of time before the rigours\\nof EC competition law force the government to give him a freer hand on\\nprices. As he pointed out in a recent interview: 'European competition will\\nin the end have its effect. Brussels will remind the government that the\\nelectricity market will conform to competition rules.'\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3414': \"IN THE run-up to its privatisation last month, National Power, the largest\\nelectricity company in the UK, issued its managers with a little blue book.\\n'Transforming National Power' was a hymn of praise to change. It was written\\nby a management consultant who had been appointed as the personal adviser on\\nnew working practices to Mr John Baker, National Power's chief executive.\\n'Lean', 'flexible', 'open', 'entrepreneurial' and 'commercial' are the\\nbuzzwords running through the booklet.\\n'Committee Rule was the old philosophy,' it enthuses. 'Now the ability to\\ntake individual management decisions must become accepted behaviour - in\\nfact, people who respond quickly and effectively without going through the\\nhierarchy will be encouraged.'\\nIt would be easy to poke fun at the often over-simplied homilies which make\\nup much of its 65 pages. Yet the message it contains would come as a shock\\nto most managers in many of the state-owned, monopoly-protected utilities\\nwhich still characterise much of the electricity industry worldwide.\\nChanging the management culture was one of the most important tasks that\\nNational Power's top executives set themselves in preparation for\\nprivatisation. Mr Baker and his immediate lieutenants have been stung by\\nfrequent taunts, not least from the City, that National Power was slower\\nmoving and more bureaucratic than PowerGen, its smaller rival. If that were\\nnot bad enough, the lessons of previous privatisations, such as those of\\nBritish Gas and British Telecom, spoke volumes about the difficulties facing\\nutilities in adjusting to the cold wind of the private sector.\\nEach of the company's 35 power stations has been turned into a profit\\ncentre, with the station manager held clearly responsible for financial\\nperformance. A sharper system of financial reporting links power station and\\nhead office. And ramming the message home is a new performance pay scheme\\nwhich can determine up to 30 per cent of a manager's salary.\\nSuch initiatives will inevitably take time to work through. Meanwhile,\\nNational Power has articulated a range of other strategies for improving its\\nperformance in the private sector. Top of the agenda is cost cutting.\\nNational Power has already shed about 1,000 jobs, reducing its workforce to\\njust over 15,000. That leaves its stated target of losing another 4,000 jobs\\nover the next five years, although industry observers will not be surprised\\nif that target is exceeded.\\nTwo thirds of the job losses are likely to come from power station closures,\\nwith the rest from more efficient working across the company. In the past\\nyear, National Power has shut five of its coal-fired stations, contributing\\njust over 1,000MW towards its stated goal of closing 3,000MW of capacity by\\nthe middle of the decade - a target which the prospectus warns might be\\nexceeded.\\nNot only does closure help cut costs; it is also central to National Power's\\nfuel strategy. The company wants to reduce its dependence on fuel from\\nBritish Coal, switching instead to gas, because gas-fired stations using\\ncombined cycle technology are quicker to build, cheaper to run and more\\nenvironmentally friendly.\\nThe other plank in National Power's fuel strategy is an increase in coal\\nimports, which are typically cheaper than supplies from British Coal.\\nOverall, Mr Baker plans to cut National Power's fuel bill by about Pounds\\n250m, or 10 per cent, within about five years.\\nBut National Power is bound to remain heavily dependent in the medium term\\non British Coal, which will supply National Power with about 43.6m tonnes of\\ncoal this year.\\nIndeed, National Power's directors were only prepared to commit themselves\\nin the privatisation prospectus to 'a progressive dividend policy' until\\n1993, the expiry date for the coal contract and the other arrangements\\nnailed in place by the government to give the industry stability in its\\nearly years in the private sector.\\nAfter 1993, the prospectus warned, 'National Power will be operating in a\\nmore competitive market, and revenues will be sensitive to the balance\\nbetween demand and available capacity and to other market conditions.'\",\n",

It\\nsupplies around 9mMW hours of electricity, to 100 customers - on average\\nslightly smaller customers than National Power - and has 21 power stations.\\nIt will make a pro forma profit before tax of Pounds 264m in the year ending\\n31st March 1991, and expects to pay dividends of Pounds 43m, according to\\nthe flotation prospectus.\\nBut it has done its best to capitalise on seeming small and approachable.\\n'The customer is king,' says Mr Wallis, and the company made a point of\\noffering the regional electricity companies, its largest customers,\\ncustomised packages of electricity.\\nIt has won other customers like this: Toyota was seduced with a tailor-made\\ncontract and was the first large industrial customer to sign to take\\nelectricity directly from a generator.\\nBut this accommodating philosophy did not stop PowerGen from competing\\nfiercely with the regional companies to supply large customers, during\\nrecent bargaining rounds. PowerGen had been very aggressive, several\\nregional companies reported, and was undercutting their offers.\\nNot so, says Mr Roberts. 'We offered the same prices to the regional\\ncompanies as we did to direct customers.' But PowerGen does not deny it is\\nkeenly interested in winning more large customers.\\nThe company's attitude to price is, similarly, hardheaded. Electricity is,\\nMr Wallis says, a commodity, and despite all the talk of customer relations\\nthere is no chance the company will forget the importance of competitive\\npricing.\\nPowerGen has been equally vigorous in its approach to fuel purchasing and\\nparticularly in diversification away from traditional coal-fired generation.\\nIt was the first generator to commission a new combined cycle gas turbine\\npower station, and has secured gas supplies for a 680MW station at Rye House\\nin Hertfordshire, as well as the 900MW Killingholme station on Humberside -\\nwhich will take all the gas from the North Sea Pickerill field in the first\\nsuch single field deal.\\nPowerGen's commitment to new gas technology is matched by its interest in\\nthe latest coal technology. It has invested in a British Coal project at\\nGrimethorpe in Yorkshire, which is developing combustion technology to burn\\ncoal more cleanly, and has joined the US electrical power research\\ninstitute, EPRI, which has made considerable investment in clean coal\\ntechnology.\\nThe company has already invested Pounds 250m in flue gas desulphurisation\\n(FGD) technology which scrubs the gases that leave coal-fired stations for\\nits Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottingham.\\nBut PowerGen is also looking hard at importing foreign, low sulphur coal.\\nFour out of its five large coal-fired power stations have easy access to\\ncoastal terminals, making it easy to import, as the company has pointed out.\\nIt is pursuing a policy of diversification away from UK coal.\\nWhether innovation will actually help PowerGen compensate for its size is\\nanother question.\\nIt is already true that National Power has more control over the bidding\\nwhich sets the electricity price in the pool, or spot market, simply because\\nit has more power stations than PowerGen. This, however, may begin to change\\nas more independent power stations come onstream.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3416': \"'LIKE A system of outdoor relief for the City,' is how Mr Frank Dobson,\\nshadow energy secretary, has scornfully described the long list of advisers\\ninvolved in the complex privatisation of the electricity industry.\\nCertainly the number of people who have been drafted in is large. Last\\nautumn, one estimate put the total on the government's side at about 700,\\nand that was excluding those working on the Scottish sale.\\nYet the merchant bankers, solicitors, accountants, stockbrokers and printers\\ninvolved in the privatisation process hotly deny they are overly rewarded.\\n'It has tied up lots of our people and frankly we could have made more money\\nout of doing something else.' said one merchant banker.\\nIt is not surprising that advisers have found it irksome. The telephone\\ndirectory-sized prospectus for the 12 regional electricity companies (Recs)\\nhad advisers working a seven-day week from last August to the start of\\nNovember.\\nBut while in the run-up to the Recs' Pounds 5.2bn flotation there were no\\nconflicts of interest between government advisers and those looking after\\nthe companies, during negotiations over the generators, relations between\\nthe Department of Energy and Lazard, representing National Power and SG\\nWarburg for PowerGen, became ever more fraught.\\nThis was partly because the government kept changing its mind about how to\\nsell the companies, before they were eventually floated jointly on the\\nmarket in February.\\nMr John Wakeham, energy secretary, sprung a nasty surprise on PowerGen last\\nsummer when he flirted with the idea of selling it in a trade auction,\\nunderwritten by Hanson, the industrial conglomerate.\\nSG Warburg had found itself in the complicated position of being told to\\nerect a Chinese wall inside its corporate finance department, between those\\npeople advising the independent directors of PowerGen and those advising the\\nmanagers on a mooted MBO. Then in August Mr Wakeham executed an about-turn\\nand reverted to the idea of floating the company.\\nAnother surprise came in January when the Department of Energy decided to\\nsell 60 per cent instead of 100 per cent of the shares in the companies'\\ncombined flotation.\\nThe companies' advisers complained that they had not been properly consulted\\non the decision. Many felt the decision had been taken against the advice of\\nKleinwort, the government's financial adviser.\\nBut despite all the bitterness that had arisen, the department still\\nbelieved it could congratulate itself on its handling of the City during the\\nsale\\nbecause it managed to introduced a number of unusual features into the\\nflotation structure.\\nThese altered the relationship between the government and the underwriting\\ninstitutions, marking a departure from the traditional underwriting method,\\nwhereby investors were allocated shares simply in relation to their\\nweighting in the London equity market.\\nHowever, this would not encourage institutions - who know they would get a\\ncertain amount whatever ludicrous level they suggested - to be forthcoming\\nin discussions about how the shares ought to be priced. Instead, Kleinwort\\ncarried out a bookbuilding operation based on practice in the Euro-equity\\nmarket. Here, institutions were asked to say precisely how much stock they\\nwould take within a range of prices. Those prepared to buy at the keenest\\nprices were favoured when allocations were made.\\nThere was a further reshuffling of shares between underwriters, just before\\nstock market dealings started. This so-called 'back-end tender' was designed\\nto ensure that at least part of the sale - 16 per cent - would be sold at a\\nprice reflecting that at which the shares would start trading, some two\\nweeks after the 100p partly-paid issue price had been struck.\\nIn the tender, underwriters were invited to rebid for shares at levels above\\n100p, being required to pay the price they bid. The tender added Pounds 42m\\nto the Pounds 2.16bn flotation proceeds.\\nDespite initial concerns that the City would not stomach these ideas, Mr\\nWakeham was sufficiently encouraged by the results to declare the flotation\\na 'text-book exercise'.\\nBut another surprise was to come. Nomura, the Japanese securities house,\\nwhich had not bid aggressively in the back-end tender, began buying large\\namounts of stock in the market. This for a short time, pushed the shares to\\npremiums as high as 140p compared with their 100p partly-paid price - just\\nwhat the department and Kleinwort had gone to such trouble to avoid.\\nNomura's reasons are still not entirely clear, but it has said it was unable\\nto bid heavily in the tender to satisfy strong demand at home because of a\\nMinistry of Finance rule covering offers for sale - the method by which the\\nshares were being distributed in Japan while the tender was going on. This\\nwould have prevented Nomura offloading shares acquired in the tender at\\nprices above 100p.\\nDaiwa, lead manager for Japan in the Scottish companies' sale, is currently\\nin discussions with the Ministry of Finance to find a way round this\\nproblem.\",\n",

They may sound like commonsense, but these household\\nhints are a central plank - although some say a shaky one - of the UK\\ngovernment's environmental strategy for the electricity industry.\\nThey come from Yorkshire Electricity's recently published Code of Practice\\non the efficient use of electricity. Under the regulations of the new\\nelectricity industry, each regional electricity company must publish such a\\ncode, helping the public get more value from each unit of electricity.\\nThe industry rarely talks about using less electricity, environmental\\nlobbyists such as Friends of the Earth point out. 'A reduction in\\nelectricity sales is needed to reduce the threat of global warming,' the\\ngroup insisted in a document published in October last year.\\nElectricity is, Friends of the Earth says, 'Britain's number one\\ncontributor' to both global warming and acid rain.\\nEvery unit of electricity (kWh) used, the group points out, means the\\nemission of nearly 1kg of carbon dioxide (CO), one of the 'greenhouse'\\ngases. The UK electricity industry is responsible for around 33 per cent of\\nthe CO released into the atmosphere every year.\\nIt is also a leading producer of the gases that cause acid rain - nitrogen\\noxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxides (SOx), annually releasing around 0.8m\\ntonnes of NOx - 71 per cent of the UK total - and 2.6m tonnes of SOx - 29\\nper cent of the national total.\\nThere are two basic ways to deal with the problem - developing technology to\\ngenerate electricity more cleanly and efficiently; and using less of it, or\\nenergy efficiency.\\nJapan is often held up as a model - its energy ratio is 2.7 compared with\\nthe UK's 4.2, undeniably helped by the fact that energy is expensive. It\\nalso has a package of stringent regulations enforcing energy efficiency such\\nas labelling for electrical appliances, setting building standards and\\ngiving incentives for energy saving measures.\\nThe UK government has begun to go the same way - although not far enough,\\nits critics say. It will spend Pounds 26m this year on grants to help low\\nincome households use less energy, and will probably introduce a voluntary\\nappliance labelling scheme next year.\\nIn addition, under the new electricity industry regulations, all users pay a\\nlevy on electricity generated from fossil fuels which then goes to fund more\\nenvironmentally friendly methods of producing electricity. All the regional\\nelectricity companies, moreover, must take a certain percentage of their\\nelectricity from these 'renewable' sources, such as wind or wave power.\\nThe government's white paper on the environment sets a target of 1,000MW to\\nbe generated from renewables by the year 2000, and has further said they\\ncould provide 24 per cent of UK energy by 2025. But from the electricity\\nindustry's point of view, what really matters is finding ways to make fossil\\nfuel production of electricity cleaner.\\nThe industry is under pressure - new UK legislation, under the auspices of\\nthe EC, will require power stations to cut SOx emissions to 60 per cent\\nbelow 1980 levels by 2003, while NOx must be 30 per cent lower than in 1980\\nby 1998.\\nAnd the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), has set a target of\\nstabilising CO at 1990 levels by 2005, with which the UK has conditionally\\ncomplied.\\nThere are three main options for the industry. First, it can clean up after\\ncombustion of coal or oil, notably by fitting scrubbers known as 'flue gas\\ndesulphurisation' or FGD units to the power station chimneys, which clean\\nthe gas as it leaves.\\nThis is the route the UK has so far adopted - 8,000MW of FGD are being\\nfitted at present. However, few people regard this as an adequate long-term\\nsolution: FGD does not deal with NOx and critics point out that 8,000MW is a\\nnegligible amount compared with continental FGD installations.\\nThe second option is to switch into another fuel. Natural gas is the\\nfrontrunner. It releases very little sulphur or nitrogen, and burnt\\nefficiently in a new 'combined cycle gas turbine' station (CCGT) which\\nrecovers waste heat from combustion to drive a steam turbine, it is around\\n50 per cent efficient compared with 37 per cent at best for a conventional\\ncoal fired station. This means less CO is released per unit of electricity\\nproduced. Most of the new power stations due to come onstream in the mid-90s\\nin Europe will be CCGT.\\nThe third option is to devise technology that burns coal more cleanly. In\\nEurope and the US a new generation of coal-fired power stations is being\\ndeveloped. By the 1990s they will be up and running - and green enough,\\ntheir creators say, to compete with gas.\\nThere are other variants: in the UK British Coal has masterminded a process\\n -known as 'the topping cycle' which combines partial gasification with the\\nnew combustion technology. These clean coal technologies can cut emissions\\nof sulphur by up to 99 per cent, and nitrogen by between 80 and 90 per cent.\\nBy improving efficiency from 35 per cent to up to 46 per cent they also cut\\nCO emissions.\\nThe UK has no plans for any clean coal plant. The government has invested\\naround Pounds 20m in clean coal research, and is currently conducting a\\nreview of the area, which may result in further investment later this year.\\nSo far the money to fund a clean coal plant - a new technology that involves\\ncommercial risk so cannot win City backing - is just not there.\\nUltimately, however, it will only be built when the two electricity\\ngenerators order it, and while gas continues to be cheap and available, they\\nare very unlikely to do so.\\nBut environmentalists should take heart. A quiet revolution in industry's\\nuse of electricity is taking place. CHP or combined heat and power systems,\\nwhich generate electricity and heat from a single source, are slowly\\ncatching on.\\nThese systems can be twice as efficient as conventional boilers and can cut\\nCO emissions by 70 per cent. If CHP capacity reaches 30,000MW by 2020, as\\nthe government hopes, national CO emissions could fall by 15 per cent.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3418': \"SLOWLY but surely, competitive forces are beginning to prise open the\\nmonopolistic and nationalistic world of electricity generation.\\nUtilities around the world are beginning to feel the cold winds of\\ncommercial pressures. 'The old watchwords of 'obligation to serve' and\\n'build new capacity to meet future demand well in advance' are being\\nreplaced by an industry built on contractual relations and commercial\\norientation,' a recent report on the European industry concluded.*\\nGovernments are cutting back their funding support for the industry and\\nlarge industrial customers are increasingly chafing at high electricity\\nprices. Meanwhile, recession is forcing the industry to pare back its\\nprojections of future demand: in western Europe, annual growth over the next\\nfew years is unlikely to reach the 3.2 per cent recorded in the second half\\nof the 1980s, let alone the 7.2 per cent of the golden years in the 1960s.\\nThe European Commission is casting an increasingly jaundiced eye over the\\ngamut of arrangements which hinder free trade in electricity within the EC.\\nLast month, the Commission gave Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece,\\nIreland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain two months to show that\\nthey were not impeding the free flow of electricity across their national\\nboundaries. Failure to do so could result in legal action by Brussels.\\n'Competition and the freedom to import and export are essential components\\nof the policies needed to create an internal energy market,' argued Sir Leon\\nBrittan, European commissioner for competition. The moves are widely seen as\\nan opening shot in what is likely to prove a long battle with the utilities\\nto create 'open access' in electricity supply, thereby allowing large\\nbusiness customers to shop around for cheaper power.\\nThe UK industry has seen the greatest changes over the past year, as the\\ngovernment's privatisation programme has come to fruition. The flotation of\\nthe 12 regional electricity companies, together with National Power and\\nPowerGen, the conventional generators, completed the process in England and\\nWales. They will shortly be joined in the private sector by Scottish Power\\nand Scottish Hydro-Electric, the two Scottish companies due to make their\\nstock market debut in June. That will leave only the industry in Northern\\nIreland, which is scheduled for sale next year.\\nRadical though these privatisations are, perhaps even more innovative has\\nbeen the UK's attempt to create a new trading market in electricity known as\\nthe pool. It is still too early to judge the success of this new market, the\\nheart of the government's attempt to inject competition into the industry.\\nPessimists fear that the electricity regulator will find the new structure\\ninadequate for fostering full competition in the industry, just as his\\ncounterparts in gas and telecommunications have found in their domains. Yet\\nthe electricity companies have already begun to forge new strategies to meet\\nthe demands of the private sector, notably by switching their power plant\\nordering programme away from large coal stations towards gas.\\nThe switch towards gas-fired generation has become a notable trend\\nthroughout the industrialised world. Gas stations are quicker to build and\\ncheaper to operate than large coal or nuclear plants. Crucially, they also\\nhave environmental benefits, emitting less sulphur dioxide (which causes\\nacid rain) and carbon dioxide (which causes global warming) for an\\nequivalent amount of energy as coal stations.\\nIndeed, green pressures are now the number one concern of many utilities, as\\npublic awareness of the environment, the flow of eco-regulations and the\\ncost of cleaning up plant mount in almost equal measures. Nowhere is this\\nmore true than in eastern Europe, where the newly democratic countries face\\nthe twin task of reducing their dependence on inefficient coal-fired\\nstations and dealing with the aftermath of inadequate safety standards in\\nSoviet-designed nuclear plant.\\nCollaboration between the two formerly divided halves of Europe is likely to\\nmount. Czechoslovakia has already signed a technical accord with France,\\nwhereby Europe's premier nuclear nation will help the Czechs to upgrade\\ntheir eight Soviet-designed reactors to EC standards. Germany has been\\nputting together a powerful consortium of west German utilities, leavened by\\nsome non-German firms led by Electricite de France, to modernise east\\nGermany's industry. One estimate suggests that investment of DM30bn-DM50bn\\n(Pounds 10bn-Pounds 16.6bn) will be needed in east Germany's industry over\\nthe next six years.\\nWhile prospects are good for gas-fired and combined heat and power plants,\\nthe nuclear industry worldwide remains in the doldrums. Having braced itself\\nfor a burst of bad publicity to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the\\nChernobyl nuclear disaster, the industry has to cope with an even more\\nintractable problem: a continuing dearth of orders over the next decade.\\nThose countries, such as France where public acceptance of nuclear power\\nremains high, tend to have a surplus of capacity; whereas in others, notably\\nthe US, there is no sign of the public distrust of the nuclear option\\nwaning.\\n* European Electric Power Trends.

In\\nparticular, China has criticised the size and cost of the project and its\\nimpact on Hong Kong's post-1997 financial reserves and debt.\\nBut behind the detailed airport arguments, China has been establishing a\\nprecedent to exert increasing influence over Hong Kong government decisions\\nin the run-up to 1997. It has won a say over the use of the government's\\nHKDollars 73bn financial reserves for funding the airport, and it has\\ndemanded consultations leading to consensus on a wide range of other issues\\nconnected with the project, which it would want to scrutinise.\\nThis is causing considerable concern in Hong Kong because it has\\ndemonstrated how easy it is for China to interfere in the colony's affairs\\nand slow down free-market developments before and after 1997. After initial\\nresistance, Hong Kong has accepted the need for consultation on issues such\\nas the airport which straddle 1997, but it has been reluctant to concede\\ndemands for anything approaching consensus which could give Peking an\\neffective veto.\\nChina and Britain agreed in 1984 that Hong Kong would enjoy a 'high degree\\nof autonomy' as a Special Administrative Region for 50 years after 1997\\nunder a formula called 'one country two systems'. This was intended to leave\\neconomic and political traditions intact.\\nThere has always been concern that China would try to fudge this agreement\\nand interfere for a mixture of political and bureaucratic reasons after\\n(1997, and that this would probably slow down the growth and effectiveness\\nof Hong Kong's economy. But few people expected China to show its hand so\\nearly.\\nChina claims it has a right to a say because the 1984 Sino-British agreement\\nrequires increased consultation in the second half of the 1984-97 transition\\nperiod, which is just beginning. It also says that it has a duty to the 6m\\npopulation to ensure that Britain leaves the colony and its economy in good\\norder.\\nBasically, China does not trust Britain, and senior officials suspect that\\nthe UK will behave like other departing colonial powers and cream off the\\nriches before it goes. Similar suspicions are attached to the nearby\\nPortuguese enclave of Macao, which goes back to China in 1999, and which is\\nalso running into problems with an airport project.\\nIn the Hong Kong scenario, the UK is suspected of organising the airport so\\nthat the colony's financial reserves could be drained to pay British\\ncompanies' for money-spinning construction contracts.\\nThere is also a lack of understanding in China about capitalism and\\nwheeler-dealing traditions. Peking officials are concerned that Hong Kong\\nand Macao might be behaving like other Chinese provinces which launch\\nover-ambitious projects that cannot be completed prof itably and could then\\nland Peking with the debt.\\nPeking is widely acknowledged to be justified in its demands for\\nconsultation and increasing involvement in Hong Kong's affairs as 1997\\napproaches. But the way it has pursued this target since the Tiananmen\\nSquare crisis has seriously knocked confidence in Hong Kong's chances of\\nsurvival as a thriving international entrepot and financial centre after the\\nsovereignty handover.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3433': \"CHINA is a difficult place to do business. It has a lot of idiosyncrasies\\nand doing business here takes a lot of time and effort. That is why to deal\\nin it successfully, it is often not a place for a small company.\\nHowever, to ignore China can be a serious mistake. For experienced business\\npeople there is money to be made here.\\nWhat follows are some guidelines from veteran China traders and from\\nPeking-based diplomats about how to do business in this complex market.\\nTrips should be well planned. Visas are necessary. Business visas can be\\nobtained from any Chinese embassy, but travellers need a letter of\\ninvitation from a Chinese host organisation. For those lacking a Chinese\\nsponsor, some embassies will help their nationals obtain one. Most, however,\\nwill not get involved.\\nYet a business visa is not always necessary. For those who are coming to\\nChina for their first or second time, a tourist visa will suffice and is\\nreadily obtainable in Hong Kong.\\nTravelling around the country used to be a nightmare for anyone with a fixed\\nschedule.\\nThat has begun to change as the Civil Aviation Administration of China\\n(CAAC), China's national airline, has gradually computerised its operations.\\nIt is now possible to buy round trip tickets to a handful of major cities in\\nChina.\\nInterpreters are vital for those who cannot speak Chinese. The Chinese host\\nwill always supply an interpreter, but it is better to bring their own to\\nany business meeting.\\nOne way to find an interpreter is for the business traveller to ask at his\\nor her country's business trade council in Peking. For British citizens, the\\nChina Britain Trade Group in Peking and Shanghai will help at minimal cost.\\nNewcomers to China should be aware of significant cultural differences in\\nthe Chinese and Western ways of doing business. Patience, determination and\\nstrong financial backing are essential, but equally important is recognition\\nof the fact that the Chinese concept of time differs dramatically from that\\nof the west.\\nNegotiations with the Chinese take time and time is only occasionally\\nimportant to the Chinese, a western diplomat says. First or even second time\\nbusiness people should not expect to conclude a deal.\\nDuring the first visit, the businessman needs to obtain from the relevant\\ncommercial sections of embassies or from the Ministry of Foreign Economic\\nRelations and Trade (MOFERT) some idea of the official policy towards his\\nproduct.\\nIf the products are in a priority sector that is part of the government's\\neighth Five-Year Plan, significant opportunities may be developed. However,\\nsome products fall in a grey area or are actively discouraged by the\\ngovernment and banned from being imported.\\nThere are many ways of blocking imports. China has a complex system of\\ntariff and non-tariff controls to restrict foreign companies' access to its\\ndomestic market.\\nSome of the barriers include:\\nimport bans;\\nimport licenses (which can be denied if domestic alternatives are available,\\nor if the goods are considered incompatible with China's goals);\\na strict import substitution policy that restricts competition;\\nforeign exchange allocation;\\ntesting and certification of foreign products to specifications not applied\\nto domestically-produced goods.\\nOnce a businessman has decided to be in the China market, he should remember\\na few basic rules:\\nnever sign a loss leader. The Chinese are tough, organised negotiators who\\nknow the real value of any product.\\ndon't begin the first sale on the basis of losing money in order to gain\\naccess.\\nknow your end user's needs well. Rely on multiple channels for information\\nand never use only one source.\\nbuild a coalition of relationships with people involved in making the\\ndecision.\\nFor those serious about being in the China market, but who cannot afford to\\nstaff it with their own representative, there are various alternatives.\\nChina's telecommunication links with the rest of the world have improved\\ndramatically in the last decade, and calling or sending a fax is now simple.\\nBut there is no substitute for a good agent in a country where personal\\nrelationships are extremely important.\\nAgents provide contacts. Just as selecting an agent is important for those\\nexporting to China, choosing a partner in a joint venture operation is\\nperhaps the single most important decision a foreign company will make.\\nFinding a suitable partner takes time and knowing where to start can be a\\ndaunting process, but much depends on the foreigner's line of business and\\nwhether the goal is to export or manufacture.\\nGenerally, big cities, the coastal provinces, and the south are favourite\\nareas of business for foreign trade.\\n'Anywhere but Peking, and the farther south you go the better,' a western\\nbusinessman says.\\nOther points to consider in selecting a partner include the organisation's\\nproximity to raw materials, electrical supply and shipping facilities.\\nFinally, don't let the system wear down your mental and professional\\nfaculties, as happened to a French businessman who had been negotiating with\\nthe Chinese over a problem for a year and a half.\\nWhen he believed he had finally resolved the matter and was preparing to\\nboard his aircraft for home,the Chinese came to him at the airport, saying\\nanother organisation had not agreed to the terms and problems remained.\\nThis was too much. The Frenchman was subsequently found running naked around\\nTiananmen square and was taken out of China in a straitjacket.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3434': \"IF WUHAN, the capital of Hubei province, is set to become one of China's\\nmain communications hubs - as local officials claim, and a glimpse at any\\nmap would endorse - how is it that Peking newspapers take three or four days\\nto arrive?\\n'We are the Chicago of the Orient,' Zhao Baojiang, the mayor of Wuhan,\\nclaims in a grand hyperbolic sweep.\\nWuhan is also at a critical midpoint on the Yangtze river, and sits abreast\\nChina's main north-south railway, linking Hong Kong and Guangdong in the\\nsouth with Peking and the land-bridge to Europe in the north.\\nIn a country with normal communications, Wuhan's pivotal location would\\nproject it to the commercial and industrial centre-stage. Peking papers\\nwould be available on the day of publication. But in China, it stands as a\\nmonument to the awful impoverishment of the nation's communications.\\nThe city's time may indeed come. But it will take considerable improvements\\nin the national transport infrastructure to transform its prospects. It will\\nalso require the creation in China of a true national market. At present, a\\nlabyrinth of bureaucratic obstacles to trade across provincial boundaries -\\nwhich amount to nothing less than provincial protectionism - make Wuhan's\\ncentral location in China a commercial irrelevance.\\nThis perhaps explains why Hubei province has slipped in the past five years\\nfrom China's ninth most important exporter to its 13th.\\nIt also explains why a province that is among the best endowed in China in\\nterms of agricultural and mineral resources, and in terms of industrial and\\ncommercial capacity, has failed to make a more powerful mark among the\\ncountry's magnets for foreign investment.\\nHubei's endowments are prolific: the Jianghan plain which straddles the\\nYangtze in the heart of the province is among the most fertile in China. Its\\nred alluvial soils grow about one fifth of the country's cotton and makes\\nHubei China's fifth largest grain producer.\\nLakes spread across the south of the province - some of them more like\\ninland seas - provide a living for almost a quarter of a million fish\\nfarmers, and underpin an industry in aquatic products that ranks third in\\nChina.\\nThese together make Hubei one of China's leading textile manufacturers and a\\nleader in food processing.\\nRich supplies of iron, copper and an array of rarer minerals mainly in the\\neast of the province around Huangshi supply one of China's largest steel\\ncomplexes and a leading special steels manufacturer. These in turn underpin\\nthe country's second largest automotive manufacturer, in Shiyan in Hubei's\\nnorth-west.\\nA combination of these resource-riches, and Hubei's pivotal location at the\\nheart of China, make it clear that few provinces would stand to gain so much\\nfrom the dismantling of centralised controls over China's economy, and the\\nloosening of the domestic market.\\nLocal officials may not yet be fully aware of the riches liberalisation can\\nbring but in the meanwhile are committed to infrastructural improvements\\nover the decade ahead that will be of significant help when the virtues of\\nHubei's prime location at the heart of China's market are allowed to come\\ninto play.\\nA new RMB Yuan 600m international airport will be opening in 1993. A second\\nYangtze road bridge joining Hankou and Wuchang will enhance north-south\\ncommunications in the province and ease traffic congestion in Wuhan itself.\\nRailway electrification is planned. A new 50,000-line telephone exchange is\\nbeing installed. Massive investment in both thermal and hydro power stations\\nis being made.\\nEconomic zones are being established in Wuhan and in Yichang and Huangshi\\nalong the banks of the Yangtze. They are intended to capitalise on the\\ncreation of Shanghai's Pudong special economic zone over the coming decade.\\nThis development underlies one of the most exciting changes now underway:\\nthe re-establishment of the Yangtze, after half a century of neglect, as a\\ncritically important commercial artery in central China.\\nA new foreign trade port is under construction, a companion to Baihushan\\ncompleted just east of Wuhan six years ago. New local shippers like Datong\\nand Qingchuan are vying with former state monopolies and the fast-growing\\nprivate shipper, Minsheng, to provide competitive services along the length\\nof the Yangtze for the first time since 1949.\\nWhile Hubei has until recently had only modest success in attracting foreign\\ninvestment, lagging in particular behind coastal provinces, recent deals\\nprovide encouraging signs. A joint venture with Citroen, agreed last year,\\nwill lead to the production of 300,000 cars a year in Wuhan and Shiyan,\\nfurther enhancing the province's importance as a supplier to the national\\nautomobile market.\\nAn optical fibre plant, to be built with help from Philips, will also be\\nimportant in enhancing China's domestic telecommunications capacity.\\nForeign capital used for new equipment at the Wuhan Iron and Steel works is\\nintended to boost annual output from 5m tonnes of rolled steel to 7m tonnes\\nby the year 2000, boosting the company's role as one of China's four main\\nsuppliers of high-quality steel.\\nIf approval is given to the environmentally controversial Sanxia\\nhydroelectric project, which would be built across the Yangtze in the Three\\nGorges on Hubei's western border with Sichuan, Hubei would become a critical\\nsupplier of power to all of central China. The 13,000MW generated by Sanxia\\nwould dwarf the recently-completed Gezhouba dam in Yichang, which generates\\n2,700MW and is already a critically important supplier to the Yangtze\\nregion.\\nAll these developments point to Wuhan's preparedness for the larger role\\nwhich would result from the creation of a nationwide market economy.\\nLocal leaders pay lip service to the need for less central control of the\\neconomy and more market freedoms.\\nBut behind the brave rhetoric, the provincial authorities are not yet\\nwilling to end subsidies to bankrupt factories.\\nIn Wuhan, the leadership appears to have taken the first significant steps\\ntowards unleashing market forces, and lifting the burden of company\\nsubsidies from the shoulders of the government. Mayor Zhao Baojiang, who\\nestimates that one in 10 Wuhan workers is employed in a loss-making factory,\\nsays: 'We are asking workers to move into the individual enterprise sector\\nif their factory is a 'losing money factory'.'\\nChinese historians say that Wuhan has often been fortunate - but only in\\nunfortunate times.\\nWith the ground now being well laid, a significant opening up of China's\\neconomy to market forces could bring fortune in fortunate times. Yet Wuhan\\nwould still have a long haul to become Mayor Zhao's 'Chicago of the Orient'.\",\n",

Now called Xiamen, it is a special\\neconomic zone and has become a focal point for investment from Taiwan, 156\\nnautical miles away across the South China Sea.\\nMore than 400 Taiwanese companies have received approval during the past\\nthree years to set up light industrial labour intensive factories involving\\ninvestment of more than Dollars 1bn. Goods ranging from Prince and Slazenger\\ntennis racquets and Phillips coffee pots to folding umbrellas, electronic\\ngadgets and textiles are being turned out in about 100 factories which have\\nstarted production.\\nFujian and Taiwan have had close links for centuries. More than 70 per cent\\nof Taiwan's total 20m population originate from southern Fujian and the\\ndialects are similar. So the area is a natural choice for Taiwan's\\nbusinessmen who want to tap China's cheap labour and land, thus escaping\\nfrom Taiwan's escalating costs and restrictive environmental controls.\\nBut the investment take-up has been slow, partly because Taiwan only allows\\nits businessmen to deal indirectly with China. This adds to costs because it\\ninvolves transporting goods through Hong Kong and channelling money through\\nNew York and other financial centres.\\nThe local economic growth rate has been between 16 and 17 per cent annually\\nfor the past two years, according to officials, with industry growing by 20\\nper cent - despite China's economic and political problems. Targets for the\\nnext five years have been set at the same levels.\\nThis reflects the sudden entry of the Taiwanese, but the breakthrough that\\nXiamen is waiting for is an investment decision from Taiwan on a Dollars 7bn\\npetrochemical plant which would dramatically change the city's fortunes. It\\nwould provide a primary industrial base and would make Taiwanese involvement\\ntake off with extensive down-stream industries.\\nThe decision rests with the Taiwan government and with the industrialist\\ninvolved, Mr Wang Yung-ching, head of Formosa Plastics which is one of\\nTaiwan's largest companies. Mr Wang, whose family comes from the area, is in\\nnegotiations with Peking and Taipei and has also talked about developing\\nventures in banking, shipping and transport.\\nTaiwan, which regards itself as the rightful government of all China, is\\nsoftening its policies but seems unlikely to permit full and direct\\ninvestment, transport and communications for a year or so. It wants to use\\nMr Wang's and other possible investments as a lever to persuade China to\\nprovide some sort of overall investment protection agreement and to reduce\\nproblems of bureaucratic corruption and scarcity of raw materials.\\nMeanwhile, Mr Wang is in negotiations on the extent and ownership of the\\npetrochemical plant, and Xiamen's government has started preparatory ground\\nworks on the site, financed according to some reports by Mr Wang.\\nThe centre of Xiamen, which consists of a series of islands adjacent to the\\nmainland with a population of 1.12m, was made a special economic zone in\\n1980. But it failed to develop significantly until Taiwan started to allow\\nthe indirect industrial investment in 1987-88.\\nAccording to local government figures, a total of 980 projects, initially\\nmostly from Hong Kong and Macao, have been approved since 1980 for projects\\ncosting Dollars 2.92bn. They include Dollars 2.12bn foreign investment, and\\nTaiwan accounts for 410 projects worth Dollars 1.07bn.\\nBut only Dollars 500m foreign investment has actually gone ahead and this\\nincludes Dollars 200m on a single project - a Taiwanese chemical fibre\\nplant.\\nAn unusually high proportion of the projects are wholly foreign owned - 309\\nout of the 410 - indicating that the Taiwanese want to control the\\nbusinesses and do not want to delay investments while joint ventures are\\nnegotiated. Most of the production is for export, supplementing the factory\\nowners' operations in Taiwan which often continue producing high-quality\\nranges.\\nFactory managers say that labour costs are 75 to 90 per cent lower than in\\nTaiwan but that there is only an overall production cost saving of around 10\\nper cent after transport, lower levels of productivity, and other problems\\nare taken into account.\\nKeen Find Sporting Goods, for example, employs 400 people to turn out 2,000\\ntennis racquets a day using frames imported from Taiwan via Hong Kong -\\ninternational trade rules ban the import of the raw material into China.\\nMr Golden Ehang, th general manager, says wages are 12 per cent of Taiwan's,\\nbut he makes only 8 per cent on overall costs. 'I have come here only\\nbecause the costings will improve when Taiwan's rules are eased - it's not\\nworth it otherwise.'\\nOne of Xiamen's strengths is that there are 350,000 overseas Chinese for\\nwhom the city is an ancestral home. They include members of such famous\\nfamilies as Mr Lee Quan Yew of Singapore and Mrs Cory Acquino of the\\nPhilippines.\\nIt has ambitions as a tourist destination, primarily based on the\\nattractions of a small island adjacent to the city centre called Gulang yu\\nwhich is full of colonial villas built for foreign consulates and companies\\n100 years ago.\\nTo help attract investment, urgently needed infrastructure projects are now\\nbeing planned.

Flooding\\nis a perennial threat to the tens of millions who live downstream, and in a\\ncountry short of energy its waters are keenly viewed as a source of\\nhydropower.\\nIn 1923, Sun Yat Sen, China\\'s first president, proposed a huge dam across\\nthe lowest gorge to control the floods. Since then the project has been\\nendlessly debated and researched by politicians, engineers and\\nhydro-electric specialists. The scheme surfaced again last year, though\\nsubject to further approval by the rubber-stamp National People\\'s Congress.\\nNow Han Hongshu, vice-governor of Hubei province, speaks as if work is about\\nto begin. Hubei has already done well out of the Gezhouba dam at Yichang,\\ndownstream of the gorges, which created new jobs and now provides power. In\\nSichuan, they are not so sure: \\'Of course the central government must\\ndecide, but we here think it would be better to spend the money on dams and\\nhydropower projects upstream on the Yangtse tributaries\", says Ma Lin, the\\nVice-governor.\\nAdvocates of the dam point to the reduction in flood risks, the 18bn units\\nof electricity a year that the scheme would generate and the improved\\nnavigability of the river, enabling ocean-going ships to reach Chongqing.\\nThe Ministry of Water Resources and Power set up a committee of 412 experts,\\nof whom more than 400 supported it, while a detailed Canadian feasibility\\nstudy also found in favour.\\nOpponents stress the enormous cost (yuan 36 bn), the number of people to be\\nresettled (a million or so), the risk of earthquake or (in the event of a\\nwar) bomb damage and unpredictable environmental consequences. They also\\npoint to illogicalities in the concept: for power generation the reservoir\\nupstream must be full, for flood retention empty.\\nIn 1989, the year of the Tiananmen demonstrations, the dam became a\\npolitical issue. A group of writers led by Dai Qing, later put under house\\narrest as a dissident, published a book opposing it as a \\'Stalinist folly\\'.\\nThey accused Li Peng, the premier, a Moscow-trained electrical engineer (and\\na one-time head of the ministry in charge of hydro-power) of trying to\\nbolster his own prestige by linking his name with a project once favoured by\\nChairman Mao.\\nThese intellectuals are silenced now, but the questions remain. Where will\\nthe resettled population go? (\\'Further up the mountains\\' said Ministry of\\nWater Resources officials). Could silting gradually fill the 500 km\\nreservoir behind the dam, leaving Chongqing literally high and dry?\\nWouldn\\'t it be better for Peking to spend the money on installing equipment\\nnationwide to save electricity rather than providing more?\\nOne look at China shows how little care is given to the environment. The\\nbuilders of the Gezhouba dam seem not to have known of the existence of the\\nYangtse sturgeon (now proudly displayed at the Yichang breeding station )\\nuntil they bumped their noses on the new barrier going upstream to spawn.\\nIt seems unlikely enough research has been done on river and marine life,\\nclimatic consequences, loss of land fertility or the greater scouring\\neffects caused by a less silt-burdened river.\\nWhile China seems unlikely on grounds of cost to build the dam in the near\\nfuture, it remains a threat as long as a totalitarian government in Peking\\ncan in the last resort overrule opposition.',\n",
       " 'FT911-3437': \"CHINA'S state industry is in a parlous condition. Everyone from premier Li\\nPeng, through finance minister Wang Bingqian to the State Statistical Bureau\\nis in agreement on this.\\nBut the narrow gap between listing industry's failings to formulating\\nsolutions seems to be unbreachable since the leap involves espousing market\\nforces and dismantling control over giant industrial machines that have for\\ndecades been the focus of political power and patronage.\\nAccording to the State Statistical Bureau (SSB), more than one third of\\nChina's state enterprises - which employ 50m of the country's 150m urban\\nworkers - are making losses. Wang Bingqian, finance minister, noted in the\\nrecent National People's Congress that the government spent the equivalent\\nof Dollars 11bn in 1990 subsidising state factories, with another Dollars\\n7.3bn spent on price subsidies for workers.\\nNoting that more than one third of the government's budget is now consumed\\nby subsidy payments, Wang admitted that enterprise losses 'have already\\nreached the point where the state treasury cannot sustain them.' Urgent\\nneeds to improve housing, medical care and the country's rudimentary welfare\\nsystem - not to mention modernising industry - are being preempted by the\\npolitical imperative of keeping state factories on life support machines.\\nWhile the gross value of industrial output (GVIO) rose 7.6 per cent in 1990,\\nthe impetus for growth came from light industry (+9.1 per cent), private\\nindustry (+21.6 per cent) and joint ventures (+56 per cent). State industry\\nlifted output by 2.9 per cent, according to the SSB.\\nEven these figures mislead, since much of the rise in output was fuelled in\\nthe middle of 1990 by a bank lending spree that was intended to lift output\\nto the level that would allow the central government to argue that state\\nplan targets for the five year plan ending last December had been met. Much\\nof this additional output went straight on to stockpiles - which increased\\nby RMB 30bn in 1990, according to the SSB.\\nWhile state enterprise losses doubled from 1989 to RMB 28bn, profits fell 58\\nper cent, and government tax receipts from state industry fell 18.5 per cent\\nbetween 1989 and 1990 to RMB 127bn, the SSB said. Over the five year period\\nfrom 1985-1990 the economic return on every RMB 100 of working capital fell\\nfrom RMB 23.8 to RMB 16.8, while profits fell from an average of 11.8 per\\ncent to 6.3 per cent.\\nThe present leadership talks of the need for reform, but appears unable to\\naccept the loss of central control that would follow. Leaders are also\\ntraumatised by a fear that the upheavals inevitably associated with\\nroot-and-branch reform would foment political rebellion.\\nSmall steps have been taken: the price of basic inputs such as coal, steel\\nand electricity is being raised closer to real market prices. A rudimentary\\nand confused tax system has begun to give companies more independence to\\ninvest profits as they think best. A free market in most goods is beginning\\nto grow up as companies are allowed to sell for themselves goods produced\\nabove plan commitments.\\nCollective and private enterprises have also come to play a bigger part in\\nthe economy, particularly in the coastal provinces and southern China,\\nreducing the political clout of state enterprises, as well as their dominant\\nimpact on the national economy. However, there is cold comfort in this\\ngrowth, since many of these collective enterprises have little intrinsic\\neconomic value, thriving mainly because of the monstrous inefficiency of the\\nstate industrial machine.\\nThe World Bank, in a recent analysis of China's economy*, praises the\\ngovernment's success in progressively increasing production of industrial\\nraw materials such as oil, coal and steel, but then argues that none of this\\nmassive investment in raising output would have been needed if industry used\\nthese materials more efficiently.\\nIt points to 'high energy and steel dependency' that is a result of being\\nsheltered from external competition, being technologically backward, using\\nobsolete capacity, and achieving very low productivof factories producing\\none-thirtieth of the output possible using more efficient technologies.\\nStaff at Wuhan Iron & Steel, one of the country's leading high-quality steel\\nmakers, endorse this view. They say only 25 per cent of China's 66m\\ntonnes-per-year steel output is usable in modern industry.\\n'Heavy industry absorbs far too much capital,' the World Bank says: 'It\\nprovides below average returns, and its appetite for energy is one of the\\nroot causes of chronic shortages.\\n'By targetting machinery and metal industries for promotion, China will\\nstarve more deserving sectors of capital, perpetuate an artificial shortage\\nof investment funds in a situation of resource availability few countries\\ncan rival, and limit its growth potential.\\n'The quantum of investment alone is not enough.'\\nRather than spend more on power generation, the government should spend on\\nreplacing old and power hungry machinery, the Bank says: rather than pay\\nsubsidies for factories to produce for stockpiles, government should spend\\non redeploying workers in new and more efficient factories.\\nEnterprise reform is at the heart of this debate. For western economists,\\nthis means plant closures on a significant scale, and willingness to allow\\nmarket forces to sort the survivors. Peking's central planners have\\npreferred to investigate 'enterprise groups', where profitable companies\\nabsorb chronic loss-makers with the aim of turning them round.\\nFor example, Shanghai Vacuum, the largest of the seven companies publicly\\nquoted on the infant Shanghai stock exchange, was forced by the municipality\\nto take on 2,400 workers from failed local enterprises in 1989. This added\\nRMB 7m to its annual payroll, and did nothing for profits.\\nYanzheng Industrial, a smaller quoted stock on the Shanghai exchange, had\\njust 100 staff until the local Jing An district government forced it to\\nassume responsibility for 100 workers from a failed factory nearby. Because\\nthere is no work for these people, they have to stay at home on full pay at\\nYanzheng's expense. A further 200 retired workers from the failed factory\\nwere put on Yanzheng's pension scheme.\\nChinese companies complain this practice is like 'whipping the fast ox'.\\nIn place of practical proposals aimed at resolving the crisis at the heart\\nof China's industry, leaders in Peking have invoked the slogan of 'Quality,\\nVariety and Efficiency' in 1991. The slogan's principal virtue is that it\\ninflicts no damage on the icon of Marxist central planning.

Guangzhou, capital of the southern province of Guangdong, is\\nalso considering a stock exchange.\\nThe significance is that there are sufficient economic reformers in Peking\\nand elsewhere to push the experiments through, despite the ideological\\nopposition of officials who fear both the economic and social implications,\\nand despite the country's political uncertainty which deters bureaucratic\\ninitiative.\\nThe central government wants to try to ease its acute cash shortage by\\nencouraging secondary markets for about yuan 114bn bonds already in\\ncirculation, and by tapping an estimated total of yuan 700bn-1,000bn\\npersonal savings.\\nIn Shanghai, there were extra reasons last December for formalising local\\nbond and share trading which had been taking place since the mid-1980s\\nacross banking counters and on kerb-sides in seven or eight company stocks\\nand 25 bonds issued by the government, financial institutions and companies.\\nPeking wants to recreate Shanghai as China's financial capital and it also\\nwants to attract funds for an ambitious Dollars 10bn industrial and\\ncommercial development planned in an area of Shanghai called Pudong.\\n'The securities market is a long term aim to develop a financial market\\nwhich will help to finance Pudong and will introduce market mechanisms into\\nresource allocation and company management,' says Mr He Gaosheng, director\\nof the Office of Shanghai Economic System Reform.\\n'But public ownership will remain the mainstay, and the share system will\\nnot become very important - it is only on trial at present and that will\\nlast for perhaps five or ten years or more.'\\nAt least some claim of the quoted companies say they have new managerial\\nfreedom, even though the government is still effectively in control.\\n'We have more autonomy in our management and less direct intervention by the\\ngovernment so we make quicker decisions on investment and other issues,'\\nsays Mr Liang Zhengsheng, vice general manager of Shanghai Vacuum Electron\\nDevice, an amalgamation of six factories producing television tubes and\\nother electrical goods which in 1987 became the first government-owned\\nenterprise to have shareholders.\\nShanghai's Developments were held up by China's economic rectification\\npolicy of the past two years, but the potential has been demonstrated since\\nDecember.\\nTrading, which is dominated by the bond market, has rocketed from an average\\nof yuan 6m a day in December to yuan 42m a day last month. Mr Wei Wenyuan,\\ngeneral manager of the exchange, forecasts that it could reach yuan 6bn this\\nyear, up from yuan 2.4bn last year and yuan 800m in 1989. An estimated 1m\\npeople out of Shanghai's 13m population are believed to have participated in\\nsecurities transactions.\\nInstitutions such as insurance companies, labour unions and workers\\nretirement funds are estimated to account for about 40 per cent of the\\ntrading, and the rest is by individuals.\\nThere are various forecasts about how fast the market will grow. The bond\\nbusiness might double in a year or so but the speed of the introduction of\\nnew companies is less clear.\\nPlans are being drawn up - but could take some time to come into force  - to\\nallow foreign investors to buy a special designation of B shares in certain\\ncompanies and at least one foreign joint venture has applied to be quoted.\\nIn Shenzhen, where trading began in 1987, transactions last year totalled\\nyuan 1.77bn, mainly in equities. There are only five listed companies and\\nthere was such rampant speculation last year, much on a kerb-side black\\nmarket and involving local officials, that government restrictions were\\nimposed and formal approval for the opening of a new stock exchange\\nheadquarters and trading floor was delayed.\\nSuch problems underline why there is deep suspicion and concern about\\nallowing any rapid expansion.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3439': \"'SICHUAN is the poorest province in China', says bouncy and fast-talking Ma\\nLin, the vice-governor in charge of the economy. 'We're worse off even than\\nTibet - our yearly per capita income is only yuan 104. Tibet gets yuan 1bn a\\nyear in aid from Peking, and we're given nothing, although our population of\\nminorities is twice that of Tibet's'\\nHis solution is more reform. Sichuan was famous as the launching pad for the\\nsuccessful rural reforms of the late 1970s, under its then leader, the\\nnow-disgraced former party boss, Zhao Ziyang. Vice-governor Ma, who hails\\nfrom one of China's richest east-coast provinces, Jiangsu, wants a greater\\n'opening to the outside world' - more foreign trade and investment.\\nExports are already doing well. Mainly agriculture-based, they rose from\\naround Dollars 300m in 1985 to Dollars 1.1bn in 1990.\\nForeign investment has made a start, despite Sichuan's inadequate rail links\\nand limited use of its main east-west artery, the Yangtse.\\nThe provincial government still has the wrong idea about foreign investors.\\n'Pepsi is eager to set up a factory in Sichuan as the population is huge and\\nit's the centre of south-western China', said Mr Wang Chongming,\\nvice-director of the province's commission of foreign economic relations and\\ntrade.\\n'We've offered them a package - if they want to come, they must renovate a\\nsteel plant and build us a TV tower with a revolving restaurant'. Conditions\\nlike these seem unlikely to tempt westerners. Most of Sichaun's existing\\njoint ventures are with Hong Kong companies who can usually make a\\nprofitable deal. A dozen or so apiece are with the US and Taiwan, and a\\nhandful with Japan. On the agenda for the future is a zinc plant, currently\\nunder discussion with Australia's BHP.\\nDespite the poverty, emphasised by vice-governor Ma, to the casual foreign\\neye Sichuan seems prosperous. Markets in Chengdu, the provincial capital,\\nare overflowing with food, flowers, pet song-birds, fluffy jumpers and\\nhi-fis. Guanghan county, 35 kms away and the site of a new reform\\nexperiment, is bursting with smart-looking busy shoppers.\\nOn the other hand, Chongqing (wartime capital of Chiang Kaishek and now, at\\na population of 14m, China's largest city) and the neighbouring towns along\\nthe Yangtse are dilapidated and filthy. Sichuan has been officially ranked\\nas fourth poorest province and may have slipped further.\\nIt has serious problems such as a huge population (now 107m) and limited\\narable land. Half its area is mountainous, inhabited by only 6m or 7m,\\nmainly ethnic non-Chinese, and the remaining 101m, 80 per cent of whom live\\noff the land, are crammed into the rest.\\n'Our farmers are getting poorer', says Ma. 'We must get on with reform.'\\nCommented one westerner with business connections in Chengdu, 'Sichuan is\\ndetermined to go its own way, though unlike Guangdong (where powerful\\nGovernor Ye Xuanping has ignored central government directives to cut back\\non reform) it hasn't openly defied Peking.'\\nOfficials are discreet, but hint at their differences with the centre. For\\ninstance, they were critical of the reflation applied to the economy last\\nyear after a massive slowdown resulting from a loan freeze. 'The new credit\\ncame too late and it didn't solve the problem', said an economist with the\\nprovincial economic commission.\\nAs in the rest of China, Sichuan's industry suffered in 1990. Adding to the\\nburden are the hundreds of old heavy industry factories moved there under\\nMao Zedong's dispersal strategy of the 1960s. These are many miles from raw\\nmaterials sources and markets and lose money at the best of times.\\nThe farming population has also been hit this year, ironically by the\\nexcellent harvest. In 1990, Sichuan produced an all-time high of 42.5m\\ntonnes of grain compared with 40.8m tonnes in 1989, but in the free-market\\nprices fell and the state commercial departments would not buy more than\\nagreed quotas. This means financial loss for farmers who had already bought\\ndiesel and fertiliser.\\nBut this plenty has given the provincial government the opportunity to\\nexperiment with freeing grain prices, currently subsidised at huge cost to\\nthe central government. In Guanghan County, 35 kms from Chengdu with a\\npopulation of half a million, from April 1 this year all grain was to be\\nsold at market prices. This meant an end to farm quotas and ration tickets.\\nGuanghan's wage-earners will receive a subsidy to make this more palatable:\\nit means a price-rise to around 50 fen (Chinese cents), from around 13 fen\\nper half-kilo. Little protest is expected - in Guanghan city in mid-March\\nshoppers at the grain store were unconcerned.\\n'We'll get an idea straight away of whether it induces farmers to plant more\\ngrain or less', said Mr Zhou Jiapei, director of Guanghan's Economic\\nRestructuring Office. 'Then in a few months we can see what the urban\\ncustomers think.' This experiment might then be applied in other parts of\\nthe country.\\nSichuan's reform principles are reflected in one of China's most successful\\nprivate businesses. The Minsheng Shipping Co. in Chongqing, which ran\\nYangtse and mainly coastal shipping before the communist victory in 1949,\\nre-emerged after 1978 to resume its business. Now managed by 68-year-old Lu\\nGuoji, son of the founder, this family business jumped from a turnover of\\nDollars 1.2m in 1985 to Dollars 40m in 1989.\\nThe registered capital is yuan 50m, of which employees hold yuan 2m. and the\\nrest is in family hands. Mr Lu has put his son in charge of the Hong Kong\\noffice and a cousin (a former researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences)\\ninto one of his light-industrial joint ventures.\\nNow handling about 50 containers a month, he plans to build his own\\ncontainer wharf and raise the number to 3,000 a month. HIs other businesses\\nare multiplying. He is making piles of money where the three other\\n(state-run) shipping companies in Chongqing are losing it. It is a pity\\nSichuan is not free to apply Mr Lu's private enterprise principles in other\\nareas.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3440': \"A NEW and bleak 30-storey hotel extension to the old Jingjiang Hotel in\\nChina's former commercial capital of Shanghai is said to epitomise a flashy\\nversion of the country's four economic modernisations - it has a steel\\nstructure, a multi-storey design, a revolving restaurant, and lifts going up\\nthe outside of the building.\\nAs China struggles forward with its economic reforms, Shanghai also has two\\nother fashionable modernisations - a proposed yuan 12bn special economic\\ndevelopment zone called Pudong, and a new stock exchange.\\nWhether any of them will succeed is open to question. The Jingjiang's\\nrevolving restaurant, like those in many of Shanghai's half empty hotels,\\nhas scarcely any customers and it jerks between revolving too quickly and\\nnot moving at all. External lifts in China tend to break down. The fledgling\\nstock exchange has taken off in a small way since it was officially launched\\nlast December, trading on the Chinese love of gambling, but little has\\nhappened yet in Pudong.\\nNevertheless Shanghai, with its population of more than 12m, is the place to\\nwatch in the next few years because it has been picked out for special\\ntreatment by Peking. The idea is to use the Pudong plan as a catalyst to\\nrestore the city to its old position as the financial and business heart of\\nChina, and to start a new modernisation drive inland up the Yangtse River.\\nThis is backed both by economic reformers, who want to breathe new life into\\nthe 1980s opening-up policies, and by older conservatives who support\\nShanghai's emerging mixture of limited free enterprise in a planned economy.\\nIt therefore provides an alternative focus to the highly prosperous\\nfree-wheeling southern province of Guangdong, of which Peking\\ntraditionalists disapprove - and it might in the distant future even\\nchallenge Hong Kong.\\nIt has been led since April 1988 by Mr Zhu Rongji, a charismatic and\\nstrong-minded 62-year old mayor, who was promoted early this month to Peking\\nto be one of China's five vice premiers. He is a reformist and is expected\\nto continue to be involved in the development of Shanghai, especially\\nPudong, but will probably be succeeded as mayor by Mr Huang Ju, a vice mayor\\nwho has been in charge of financial policy including foreign investment.\\nHis support in Peking is assumed to be based on firm backing from Mr Deng\\nXiaoping, China's veteran leader, supported by Mr Jiang Zemin, the Communist\\nParty general secretary who used to be in Shanghai.\\nThis has helped him to: shake up the bureaucracy (making marginal inroads\\ninto entrenched inertia); begin to tackle creaking infrastructural problems\\nwith major projects; encourage foreign loans and investment; pave the way\\nfor six new foreign banks; improve the lot of foreign joint ventures; open\\nthe stock exchange; and launch Pudong as a symbol of a new future.\\nThe main reform now being finalised is for housing. The aim is to tap\\nprivate savings and create more funds for housebuilding, improve\\nmaintenance, and encourage expansion of private housing which now accounts\\nfor 20 per cent of the total. People renting or buying accommodation will\\nhave to contribute to a central provident fund which they can then draw on\\nlater, and rents are being raised.\\nBut, despite all this, Mr Zhu has only scratched at the surface of an old\\nindustrial city which almost defies modernisation. Economic performance is\\nhit by antiquated over-manned factories, and Peking drains the city of much\\nof its surplus funds.\\nWhile GNP grew by 3.1 per cent last year (down from 5.3 per cent in 1989),\\naccording to government figures, the output from state sector enterprises\\ndeclined by 0.6 per cent. It was pulled down by municipally owned factories\\nwhich dropped 1.6 per cent, while those controlled and favoured by Peking\\ngrew by 9 per cent.\\nMr Zhu has not managed to in push through a policy of closing old\\nloss-making factories - there are some 10,000 old run-down enterprises -\\nthough a little progress has been made by merging manufacturers of similar\\nproducts into about 30-40 enterprise groups.\\nBut he has begun to change the climate for foreign joint ventures and two of\\nthe country's most successful (rated by a government newspaper) are in\\nShanghai producing Volkswagen cars and Pilkington glass. Foreign managers\\nsay that, despite all the problems, Shanghai has definite benefits,\\nincluding an industrial base for component manufacture.\\nFor nearly 40 years after the Communists came to power, Shanghai was used by\\nPeking as a cash cow for Peking's coffers. This was arrested three years ago\\nand a new 50-50 formula for sharing payments with the capital was\\nintroduced. But Peking has continued to make extra demands and a total of\\naround yuan 13bn has been handed over in each of the past two years, leaving\\nonly about 25 per cent of yuan 16-17bn total revenues for local spending.\\nThis is however partly offset by Peking aid for Pudong which, in every way,\\nis Shanghai's main hope for the future.\",\n",

But\\nwithin the following 60 days, it is likely that the US Congress will summon\\nthe two thirds majority it needs to veto the renewal. All will then hang on\\na Senate vote.\\nIn spite of complacency in Peking, the consequences of losing MFN status\\nwould be grave for China.\\nExports to the US would fall by at least 50 per cent, according to the\\nAmerican Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. Guangdong province, with most at\\nstake, would lose about Dollars 2bn in exports, with over 1m workers losing\\ntheir jobs. Guangdong's GDP would slump by 10 per cent.\\nDescribing the 'deadly impact' of losing MFN privileges, Mr John Kamm, then\\nPresident of Hong Kong's American Chamber of Commerce, told Congressional\\nhearings last year: 'The open coastal provinces and cities - the China of\\nreform - will be hard hit. Their leaders - supporters of the deposed party\\nsecretary Zhao Ziyang - severely undermined by rapid falls in living\\nstandards which owe much to export earnings.'\\nThis evidence, which played an important part last year in persuading US\\ncongressional critics of China to renew MFN status, is about to be replayed\\nin Washington. If anything, the mood is even more grim. Regrets in the wake\\nof the Gulf war over the price paid for supporting Saddam Hussein over past\\ndecades have prompted US leaders to toughen their stance against regimes\\nthey regard as tyrannical.\\nProtectionist sentiment in the US has also hardened. China admits a trade\\nsurplus with the US, even though it does not acknowledge that a large\\nproportion of China's re-exports through Hong Kong are in fact exports to\\nthe US.\\nAn array of administrative measures in China to trim imports have also\\naroused Washington's anger. They were introduced to tackle rampant inflation\\ninside China, as well as to shore up foreign exchange reserves ahead of a\\ndebt-repayment peak in 1992-93.\\nThe result has been to give China its first visible trade surplus since\\n1984. Exports rose 18.1 per cent in 1990 to Dollars 62bn, while imports fell\\n9.8 per cent to Dollars 53bn. A surplus on invisibles boosted the current\\naccount surplus to Dollars 13.1bn.\\nWhile textile exports have struggled against competition particularly from\\nPakistan, and petroleum exports have slipped because of mounting domestic\\ndemand, China is expected to retain a strong competitive advantage in coming\\nyears in the export of consumer electronics - including TVs, radios,\\nmicrowaves and computers - and in pharmaceuticals and machine tools.\\nTourism has also begun to recover after Tiananmen. After a 23 per cent slump\\nbetween 1988 and 1989, more than 27m tourists visited China last year, a 12\\nper cent improvement on the year. Tourism revenues have recovered to the\\n1988 level of Dollars 2.2bn after a 20 per cent fall in 1989.\\nPerhaps to the alarm of Peking's more conservative economic planners,\\ninternational trade has risen in importance to assume a considerable\\nsignificance in the domestic economy.\\nForeign investment flows have played a parallel role to trade. Peking says\\nforeign investment amounted to a record Dollars 6.57bn in 1990, a leap of\\n17.3 per cent from 1989. Since both Japan and the US say their investment\\nwas down, the impetus came largely from Hong Kong and Taiwan.\\nEven more encouraging from Peking's point of view is that hotel and property\\ndeals - which accounted for a large share of investment through the 1980s -\\nhave slumped. According to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and\\nTrade, about 90 per cent of investment last year was in manufacturing,\\nregarded as being of much greater intrinsic benefit to the economy.\\nIn a bid to attract more high technology investment, China has set up 27 new\\nhigh-tech zones across the country, lifting the total to 38. Foreign\\ninvestors in the zones will pay just 15 per cent income tax - compared with\\nthe standard rate of 33 per cent. If they export 70 per cent of their\\noutput, tax falls still further to 10 per cent. The government's aim is to\\nboost high-tech output value from the current level of RMB7bn to RMB25bn by\\n1996.\\nProspective investors nevertheless continue to complain that doing business\\nin China remains testing. Many fail to anticipate how many years it can take\\nto conclude a deal.\\nEqually commonly, 'cheap' labour can become expensive when undisclosed\\nbonuses and subsidies are added. A lack of control over land-use fees,\\nenergy costs, or provisions for infrastructure can also provide nightmares\\nfor financial controllers back at company headquarters.\\nThese and more general factors point towards a bleaker investment climate in\\nthe early part of the 1990s: the higher priorities of reconstruction in the\\nGulf, forging links in eastern Europe, or simply battening down against\\ndomestic recession, mean that many traditional western investors will not be\\nrunning hotfoot to China.\\nHowever, strong and ongoing investor interest from Hong Kong and Taiwan in\\nChina's south, and perhaps from Japan and South Korea in the north, may help\\nto insulate the country from an otherwise more difficult foreign investment\\nclimate.\\nEither way, whether Peking's conservative leaders like it or not, China's\\ndoors to the outside world have been firmly opened. The importance of trade\\nand investment to the national economy is now so great that the price of\\nclosing the doors is probably too high to contemplate. This in the longer\\nterm has to provide reformers with confidence that economic trends will\\neventually play into their hands.\",\n",

Some yuan 12bn projects are planned but total\\nexpenditure could reach yuan 30bn.\\n'Pudong will be a place for experimenting in new policies which maybe we can\\nlater apply elsewhere in China,' says Mr He Gaosheng, director of the\\nShanghai Office of Economic System Reform. 'It will not be capitalism but we\\nwill bring market mechanisms into a planned economy, with public ownership\\nremaining the mainstay. With Pudong we can develop the whole of Shanghai and\\npromote development throughout the country.'\\nBut it is difficult to envisage the plans materialising. At present Pudong,\\nwhich lies between the Huangpu and Yangtze rivers, is an uninspiring area of\\nbroken roads, 2,000 (mostly small) factories, ramshackle chemical and gas\\nplants, shabby flats, and traditional-style houses.\\nThe aim is to double the present population of 1m. The yuan 12bn expenditure\\nwill be spread over five years or longer on a free trade zone and 10\\ninfrastructure projects, some already started, including a four-berth deep\\nwater port, two major river bridges, an 8km inner ring road, and new plants\\nfor water, electricity, gas and sewage treatment.\\nOfficials say yuan 5bn will come from Peking, yuan 4bn from domestic bank\\nloans, and yuan 3bn from the Shanghai government. They are looking for\\nforeign finance - for example from the Asian Development Bank - but do not\\nexpect substantial international investment until the infrastructure\\nprojects are completed.\\nCurrently there are about 40 factories with foreign investment.

This is intended to help\\nShanghai's drive to boost its service sector from 30 per cent of GNP.\\nChina's first foreign-owned wholesale and retail businesses are also to be\\nadmitted - Yaohan, a Hong Kong-based Japanese department store group, plans\\na HKDollars 780m joint venture to open in 1995. An area has been designated\\nfor an international airport.\\nIt is difficult at this stage to assess how much of the grand Pudong scheme\\nwill actually materialise.

Since even Peking's\\nconservatives recognise the dangers, the leadership is moving with\\nreluctance towards cautious reform.\\nSmall experimental reforms are springing up all over China on a strictly\\nlocal basis, such as the introduction of stock exchanges in Shanghai and\\nShenzhen. Officials such as vice-governor Ma Lin of Sichuan province enthuse\\nabout the 'ideal way' a stock exchange raises investment funds. Secondary\\nmarkets for state bonds, previously confined to Shanghai and Chongqing, have\\nbeen successfully launched elsewhere.\\nDeregulation of grain prices, as in Guanghan near Chengdu, capital of\\nSichuan, is happening on a trial basis. This follows price rises last year\\nin previously tightly controlled items such as cooking oil and cotton cloth.\\nThe yuan was devalued on April 10 for the third time in 16 months, bringing\\nit to yuan 5.26 to the dollar from the late-1989 figure of yuan 3.72.\\nForeign bankers in Peking were expecting a further cut of about 10 per cent.\\nA kind of convertibility increasingly functions through the Foreign Exchange\\nAdjustment Centres, where joint ventures can trade foreign exchange freely\\nat a market rate. Some housing reform, which either encourages tenants to\\nbuy their apartments or permits enterprises, the main providers, to set up\\nseparate self-financing corporations, is already under way, though this is\\nproving easier with new housing than apartment blocks inhabited through\\nseveral generations at peppercorn rent.\\nInsurance-based pensions, health services and social security payments are\\nalso on the agenda as devices to lessen the load of the over-burdened state\\nenterprises which currently provide them. This would allow enterprises to\\nsack workers and focus on the profitability of their core activities.\\nBut there is no sign yet that Peking will bite the bullet of abolishing\\nsubsidies which featherbed the industrial worker and cripple state finances.\\nNor will it adopt a true price reform, adopting a market system which would\\nhelp to allocate resources correctly and cut waste.\\nYet an apocalyptic scenario is hard to believe when the streets are orderly,\\nmarkets appear to be booming, new office blocks and hotels adorn Peking and\\nprovincial capitals and the shops are full of the latest electronic goodies.\\nLast year, China turned in a creditable economic performance with a record\\nharvest of 435m tonnes and a respectable GNP and industrial growth rates (5\\nand 6 per cent respectively). Foreign trade was up, with exports performing\\nwell.\\nBut, said one westerner in Peking, 'China is still living on the impetus of\\nthe mid-1980s. While major reforms have not been rolled back, the\\ninnovations are minor. Two years of good harvests have given economists a\\nchance to push for small reforms, but this year's weather is less\\npromising.'\\nWhen Li Peng, the hard-line premier, took over economic management from Zhao\\nZiyang, the now-disgraced former party leader, in late 1988, fundamental\\nreform was effectively shelved. But the policies then applied (mainly an\\nadministrative price freeze and credit controls) did nothing to solve\\nChina's huge underlying problems of suppressed demand and inefficiency.\\nPotential inflation is still ticking away under the surface, fuelled by\\nChina's growing deficit financing and subsidy policy. In 1990, Wang Bingqian\\ntold the recent Congress that the budget deficit was, according to Chinese\\naccounting (which reckons government borrowing as revenue), yuan 15bn. This\\nwas bad enough by Chinese standards, but when adjusted to reflect normal\\npractice was much worse at yuan 48bn.\\nOn top of that, nearly a third of the yuan 340bn budget expenditure went on\\nsubsidies. The central government forked out nearly yuan 58bn to the\\nloss-making state sector plus another yuan 38bn in individual subsidies to\\ncompensate for price rises.\\nPeking is short of money anyway because of its revenue sharing system. Under\\nthe existing semi-reformed fiscal structure, a fixed tax amount is paid by\\nenterprises to local authorities who then hand only a percentage to Peking.\\nNot only is Peking's slice relatively small (a source of serious dispute\\nwith provincial leaders) but the fall in state enterprise profits last year\\n(58 per cent) meant less for everyone. This is likely to get worse since\\nmore inflation is on the cards for this year. In 1990, credit estimated at\\nyuan 250-290bn was pumped into the economy to fuel industry after Li Peng's\\ninexpert 1988-89 freeze caused near-collapse. This enabled the government to\\nmeet its industrial growth target for the year, but bodes ill for the\\nfuture.\\nMeanwhile, subsidies paid to workers continue to rise. This is seen as\\nessential by the unpopular leadership, which is deeply concerned to keep the\\nurban workforce happy and loss-making factories open. Wages are also rising\\n -up by over 18 per cent in the last quarter of 1990 compared with the same\\nperiod of 1989.\\nProtected by Peking's reluctance to implement its bankruptcy laws, state-run\\nindustry is growing more inefficient by the hour. Mostly old and badly run,\\nit is responsible for what Li Peng, in his report to the NPC, called the\\n'high consumption in production, low product quality, enormous waste in\\nconstruction, slow capital turnover, low labour productivity and serious\\nlosses'.\\nAttempts at change are hampered by the post-Tiananmen commitment to\\nideology. At the top are leaders determined to avoid the fate of the\\nCeausescus by exerting party dominance. Li Peng made a special point of\\nstressing Marxist-Leninism in his report, though he had to signal for\\napplause during his three-hour speech by shouting his words to the dozing\\ndelegates.\\nStill, a kind of compromise has been reached between the hard-liners and\\nreformists which is evident in China's new plans. Five-year programmes\\n(1991-95) and ten-year plans to cover the years to the end of the century\\nset out Peking's intentions in traditionally imprecise style. The main focus\\nis to be a move to give state managers more powers to deal with\\ninefficiencies, the improvement of infrastructure and some expenditure on\\nnew special economic zones such as Pudong in Shanghai.\\nBut the unhappy history of Chinese five year plans (most have been overtaken\\nby political upheavals before completion), inspires little confidence.

       " 'FT911-3444': \"'CHINA'S harvest last year was the best in history, but it won't be so good\\nthis year', says Mr Zhang Shaogong, of Peking's agriculture ministry. A\\nserious drought gripped north China through last winter, and though snow\\nfell in March the year's total may fall short of last year's.\\nDrought has affected areas in the south, too, and these will need heavy\\nspring rains to replenish water supplies.\\nAs a result, the summer-harvested crops - which make up a third of the\\nannual total - will definitely not reach last year's peak, and the autumn\\nharvest is unlikely to fill the gap. This can only aggravate China's other\\neconomic difficulties.\\nUnpredictable weather explains why Peking's leadership is permanently\\nconcerned over agriculture. 'Last year, the rains came when the crops needed\\nit. We dare not count on such weather again', comments Mr Zhang. 'Experience\\nshows we only get two good years in five.'\\nAll agricultural sectors shone in 1990. Cotton output rose by more than 18\\nper cent to 4.47m tonnes, and oilseeds, which in the form of cooking oil\\nprovide an indispensable part of Chinese cuisine, by nearly 25 per cent to\\n16.2 m tonnes. Meat, milk, fruit and sugar crops, increasingly adding\\nprotein and diversity to the diet, were up substantially.\\nBut all this plenty, especially of grain (435m tonnes), brought serious\\nheadaches.\\nAt the end of last year, tens of millions of tonnes were being kept in the\\nopen air, twice the amount lying outdoors at the end of 1989, said Bai\\nMeiqing, vice-minister of commerce, last month. Damp and pest-ridden grains\\nwere up by a quarter and a third respectively, he noted.\\nBecause of cash shortages last year (the consequence of China's nationwide\\nfinancial difficulties), Peking's commercial departments could not afford to\\nbuy more than the set quotas for storage, and the peasants were left with\\ngrain they could not sell. This surplus is a strong disincentive to growing\\nmore this year.\\nCurrently the state makes contracts with the peasants to buy 50m tonnes of\\ngrain yearly at a fixed price and in return supplies subsidised farm\\nchemicals and fuel. But since 1988 official policy has put pressure on\\npeasants to grow as much as they can, though without providing the cheap\\ninputs to facilitate it. Disappointed, many are now out of pocket.\\nAs a result, said vice-premier Tian Jiyun at a conference in March, the\\npeasants last year won no extra income and some even sustained a loss. 'Our\\nfarmers are getting poorer', says Ma Lin, vice-governor of Sichuan province.\\nPeking is right to be concerned over feeding its huge population. The\\nquestion is whether this concern is being demonstrated in the right way. The\\nreturn to individual farming (the so-called 'household responsibility\\nsystem') brought the enormous surge in farm production in the early 1980s,\\nbut, in tune with the post-Tiananmen stress on control and ideology, the\\ncollective is now back in vogue.\\nIn any case, some western diplomats argue, China is worrying about the wrong\\nthings. There is no need to stress higher grain output since enough other\\nfoods are now produced to keep the country reasonably nourished. Allowing\\nmarket forces to operate more instead of less would bring better returns.\\nAt least the central government is taking one sensible new approach. There\\nis a fresh emphasis on purchase and marketing which may enable China to\\ndistribute grain more effectively.\\nPeking has set a production target of 450m tonnes of grain by 1995 and 500m\\ntonnes by the year 2000. This will be achieved by 'improving' (how is\\nunspecified) the household responsibility system, upgrading services to\\nfarmers, stepping up the collective element in rural management,\\nstreamlining food distribution and increasing agricultural investment.\\nThe quality of the land itself is under scrutiny. China has many hectares of\\nmarginal land which will be the target of investment over the current five\\nyear plan. 'Production bases' in which Peking will invest yuan 10 bn are\\nbeing set up for grain and cotton, and more grain markets will be\\nestablished.\\nSome scepticism is in order here since, from the 1950s onward, in its more\\napocalyptic moods Peking has urged the development of marsh and\\nmountainside. Similarly, grain markets have been on the agenda ever since\\nthe mid-1980s, but without so far performing.\\nToday, however, there is hope since China is more aware of the environmental\\ndamage which may result from unwise cultivation. But optimism is not\\nreinforced by the statement of Song Ping, one of China's top six leaders on\\nthe Politbureau Standing Committee and its chief Marxist-Leninist guru, at a\\nrecent agricultural conference, that 'Using socialist ideology to arm the\\ncadres and people of rural areas and guiding the 800m peasants to firmly\\ntake the socialist road are the basic assurance for doing a good job in\\nrural work.'\\nThis old-fashioned hard-line policy is reflected in the Central Committee's\\nrecent order that the grassroots bureaucracy be improved, first and foremost\\nthe party branches. Socialist ideology and spiritual construction should\\ntake the lead. This is a far cry from Deng Xiaoping's slogan 'it is glorious\\nto get rich]' promulgated just a few years ago.\\nChina would do better to forego attempts to organise its vast rural\\nterritories and simply free the prices paid for farm products, argue some\\nwestern diplomats.\\nThe market principle would soon beget a higher output and a better\\ndistribution system. But this seems unlikely to happen in the present\\npolitical climate. Minor experiments in freeing the price of grain are in\\nprogress, for instance in Guanghan county in Sichuan province, but transfer\\nto wider arenas does not seem likely yet.\\nThe big success of rural China is the town and village enterprise sector.\\nThis grew up in the heady days of the economic freedoms of the early 1980s,\\nwhen farmers were encouraged to set up small businesses. The total value of\\nrural output last year reached yuan 1.625 bn, of which nearly 55 per cent\\nwas generated by local enterprise.\\nThis is recognised nationally as the single most important factor in raising\\nthe standard of living and even the hardest-liner has so far shown no sign\\nof trying to roll it back.\\nIt is a pity Peking cannot apply the same successful principles to food\\nproduction and sales, which would obviate the need for the new stress on\\nvillage control.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3445': \"WHEN Mr Ye Xuanping vacates his post as the liberal governor of the southern\\nprovince of Guangdong to take up a less powerful post in Peking during the\\nnext few months, an almost revolutionary dream which he is believed to have\\nwanted to write into the eighth five-year plan may go with him, or at least\\nbe diluted. It is to merge the economies of Guangdong and Hong Kong.\\nThere is, however, strong opposition from hardliners in Peking who\\ndisapprove of Guangdong's independently free-wheeling market-oriented ways.\\nHong Kong also has serious reservations, partly because it does not want to\\nendanger its current autonomy, nor make it easy for China to renege on its\\npromise of a 'high degree of autonomy' after 1997.\\n'There are, of course, problems of our different economic and social systems\\nand I would not talk about merging the economies, but we would like to have\\nsome sort of planned development,' says Mr Yi Zhenqiu, director of the\\nGuangdong Office of Economic Systems Reform. He envisages the creation of a\\nHong Kong-Guangdong economic and trade promotion committee to act as an\\nindustrial investment 'match-maker'.\\nIn the past decade, Guangdong, which has a population of 64m, has become\\nChina's most open and prosperous province, thriving on close economic links\\nbetween its Pearl River Delta area with Hong Kong. About 1.5m-2m workers in\\nthe province are employed in factories processing partially-manufactured\\nforeign goods (mostly from Hong Kong) for re-export, and another 1m are in\\nassociated activities.\\nAs many as 50,000 technical and managerial staff from Hong Kong work\\nregularly in China, a lot of them in Guangdong, and 15,000 vehicles cross\\nthe land border every day, four times as many as six years ago.\\nEconomists estimate that 20 per cent or more of Hong Kong's currency is\\nopenly circulating in Guangdong tourist and business outlets.\\nThis co-operation has been good for both areas. Hong Kong companies have\\ngained access to cheap labour and factory premises.\\nGuangdong has benefited because of the consequential wealth and economic\\nexpansion. Foreign investment totalled some Dollars 7bn during the 1980s, 90\\nper cent via Hong Kong.\\nIt went into more than 10,000 joint ventures and other enterprises, mostly\\ninvolving labour intensive light industry, plus thousands of the processing\\nfactories. The productive end of this investment has suddenly come on stream\\nduring the past two years, so that between 25 and 30 per cent of both\\nGuangdong's yuan 189bn industrial output and its yuan 43.29bn industrial\\nexports last year were generated by factories with foreign involvement.\\nBut there has been a price to pay in social terms because hundreds of\\nthousands of people regularly pour into the province looking for work. Some\\nmake up a floating labour population of more than 1m in the processing\\nfactories; others cannot find work and fuel a crime wave of armed robberies\\nand prostitution.\\nGuangdong is also frustrated that most Hong Kong businessmen only cash in on\\nthe cheap unskilled processing factory labour. They rarely lay down\\nsignificant long-term industrial investment and look to other countries for\\nhigh technology.\\nSome labour processing factories do develop into joint ventures and so\\nbecome more permanent investments.\\nBut relatively little progress has been made on the creation of a\\ntechnological and industrial base in relation to overall economic growth,\\nwhich last year amounted to 16 per cent. The new five year plan includes\\nprojects which should help by improving both electricity power supplies and\\nroad and rail transport and by creating three petro-chemical plants. The\\ncapital of Guangzhou also wants to boost its service sector by admitting two\\nnew foreign banks and by setting up a stock exchange.\\nProblems such as these prompted the idea of somehow merging the economies so\\nthat Guangdong would benefit more, and Mr Ye also talked about relaxing\\nrestrictions on the entry of goods from the colony into Guangdong's most\\nsuccessful special economic zone of Shenzhen.\\n'We have not yet put forward any firm policies to Peking, but we would like\\nto consider using Hong Kong money to help finance raw materials plants. We\\nalso have scientific ability which could be used to help Hong Kong\\nindustries develop high technological products,' says Mr Yi, floating an\\nidea which has yet to catch on in Hong Kong.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3446': \"AS the second anniversary of the crackdown at Tiananmen Square approaches,\\nthe Chinese leadership has reasserted its authority over a sullen but\\nsubdued population. However, the government faces many intractable problems,\\ncompounded by acute factional infighting which has produced a deadlock on\\nimportant decisions about policies and personnel.\\nAdding to the uncertainty is the advanced age and frail health of the\\ncountry's most powerful leaders, 86-year-old Deng Xiaoping, 83-year-old\\neconomic theorist Chen Yun, and 84-year-old president Yang Shangkun. Because\\nof their age, many observers believe a succession struggle is already\\nunderway. 'There is nobody in the younger leadership who has a decisive say\\non policy decisions,' says a western diplomat. 'All are jockeying for\\nposition , but they are holding back. The active phase - when Deng is dead\\nor incapacitated - hasn't arrived.'\\nThe Chinese leadership is a collection of interlocking, overlapping, yet\\ndistinct factions, now uneasily balanced, but prone to frequent conflicts,\\ndepending on long term interests, connections and personal relationships.\\nDominating the leadership today are octogenarians Deng, Chen, and Yang.\\nLong-time comrades and rivals, each has independent power networks\\nstretching back 50 years.\\nDeng's relationship-building dates from his early associating with Mao\\nZedong in the 1930s and 1940s. Chen's connections stem from his role as the\\ncentral architect of economic planning in post-liberation China. Yang has\\nstrong ties to the military, from the years he served as vice chairman of\\nthe central military commission under Deng. These powerful relationships\\nhave been further enhanced by those of his half-brother Yang Baibing, who is\\nhead of the general political department of the People's Liberation Army.\\nToday, each of these aged revolutionaries has younger proteges whom they are\\ncultivating for the future. The most significant at the moment is Premier Li\\nPeng, whose patron is Chen Yun. Since the massacre in Tiananmen Square, with\\nwhich he is closely associated, Li's stature has as a consensus maker, an\\neconomic thinker, and politician.\\nAlthough he is not Deng's chosen man, observers say Li is a leader with whom\\nDeng can work.\\nThe premier has identified himself with improving the country's economy and\\ncan take credit for reducing inflation and turning around China's balance of\\npayments.\\nBut he has not addressed the country's basic structural problems, and if the\\neconomy falters, he could become the scapegoat. Moreover, he is still\\ntarnished by his association with the Tiananmen Square massacre.\\nJiang Zemin, secretary-general of the Communist Party, is widely seen as\\nDeng's protege. Formerly Communist Party secretary in Shanghai, he was\\npromoted by Deng to head the party after Zhao Ziyang was ousted in May 1989.\\n'He's got the titular crown - all he has to do is maintain it,' a western\\ndiplomat says.\\nOthers to watch are Shanghai mayor Zhu Rongji, Ye Xuanping, the governor of\\nGuangdong province, both considered reformists and Li Ruihuan, former mayor\\nof Tianjin and now a politburo member, who is a middle of the road figure.\\nAt a meeting of the Chinese parliament in late March and in early April,\\nboth Zhu and Ye were given new posts in the central government in Beijing,\\nwith Zhu approved vice premier and Ye as vice-chairman the Chinese people's\\nconsultative conference, an advisory council to the government. While they\\nmay differ on many policy issues, virtually the entire leadership is said to\\nhave agreed on the need to put the massacre of June 1989 behind them.\\nClosing the book on Tiananmen Square is thought to be the reason for a\\nseries of trials this past winter in which about two dozen prominent\\nactivists were sentenced to terms of up to 13 years on charges ranging from\\ncounterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement to sedition.\\nThe trials and the muted public reaction to them demonstrated the\\neffectiveness of the government's campaign of repression. With nearly all of\\nthe student leaders who participated in the demonstrations of spring 1989\\nhaving fled abroad, here in China the dissidents lack a broad based\\nmovement. So few are in prison that they are unlikely to become lightning\\nrods of dissent. However, should opposition erupt again, these proceedings\\nwill be used as ammunition by those voicing discontent. United as the\\nleadership may be on the need to quell dissent, it remains divided on many\\nother issues, such as disputes over price reform, the power balance between\\nthe central government and the provinces, and the question of whether to\\nemphasise coastal development rather than channelling investment towards the\\nmore backward interior.\\nThe most critical problem is economic reform. The party recognises that\\nstaying power rests upon its ability to provide a higher standard of living\\nand more consumer goods. However, that requires correcting the economy's\\nstructural problems, such as eliminating inefficient, overstaffed and\\nmoney-losing state enterprises, stimulating a largely unmotivated work\\nforce, and preventing the waste of precious raw materials.\\nBut any meaningful effort to deal with these problems could erode the\\nparty's authority and eventually lead to its downfall.\\nWhile the power of the 45m-50m member communist party is still strong,\\npublic enthusiasm for orthodox Marxism-Leninism has already been seriously\\neroded by a decade of market-oriented reforms. With traditional Chinese\\nsocial values having also been destroyed by the communists, many Chinese\\nhave been put off by the attempt to revive ideological indoctrination after\\nthe Tiananmen Square massacre.\\nSome have even turned to religion. Although the party has sanctioned this to\\na limited degree, the authorities are thought to fear that the revival of\\nreligion creates a competitive world view.\\nThose who now join the party now are primarily opportunists. Apart from this\\nbattle for hearts and minds, the role of the military will also be critical\\nin the succession struggle. The composition of the various factions within\\nthe armed forces is not entirely clear, but certain issues have emerged that\\nare challenging it to its core. Foremost is the debate over whether military\\nmodernisation should take priority over ideological indoctrination.\\nThere is a generational split over this issue, and divisions already present\\nbefore the Gulf war are believed to have widened. For the younger\\ngeneration, some of whom have travelled outside China, the overwhelming\\nAmerican technological superiority in the Gulf war is thought to have made a\\ndeep impact.\\nFor them, professional competence and acquiring more modern equipment are\\nmore important than ideological purity.\\nMoreover, most of the funds from a recently announced 12 per cent increase\\nin the defence budget are believed to be earmarked for acquiring more modern\\nequipment for the air force and navy. But the PLA's older generation still\\nbelieves in Mao's doctrine of a 'people's war', with its superior numbers\\nand greater morale being more important than technology.\\nYang Baibing, the secretary general of the central military commission, is\\nbelieved to have spearheaded the drive toward s re-politicising the PLA.\\nApart from modernisation, questions have been raised about the military's\\nrole in internal security. Some feel the army should have been a last resort\\nin the crackdown at Tiananmen Square. After the massacre, the army was\\nreorganised and regional commanders loyal to the forces of Yang Shangkun\\nwere put in charge.\\nHowever, it remains unclear which group the military will support once the\\noctogenarians begin to die. Both western and east European diplomats foresee\\na situation comparable to 1976 when Deng Xiaoping and senior military\\nleaders staged a coup d'etat by arresting chairman Mao's widow and the Gang\\nof Four shortly after Mao's death.\\nUntil Deng leaves the scene, the leadership remains in a political gridlock,\\nunwilling to take risks to face the future.\",\n",

Whatever the differences with Moscow over the\\ncorrect path for the development of a socialist state, the wholesale\\ndiscrediting of the socialist model is of as little comfort to China as it\\nis to Moscow.\\nAggravating Gorbachev's misfortunes would only increase the risk that chaos\\ninside a disintegrating Soviet Union would spread up to, and across, China's\\ncentral Asian borders, perhaps fomenting unrest in its own minority areas.\\nBy standing firmly for stronger central control, and by resorting to the\\nmilitary for help, Gorbachev has struck a resonant chord among China's\\nleadership.\\nThere is, therefore, powerful symbolism in China's recent SFr1.5bn\\n'commodity loans' to Moscow - the first made to the Soviet Union by its\\none-time protege, and Peking's friendliest gesture to Moscow in decades.\\nNext month's visit to Moscow by Jiang Zemin, China's Prime Minister, is also\\nthe first of such seniority since Mao Zedong went there in 1957.\\nAlongside the symbolic succour, there is also powerful self interest.

Support\\nfor the allied cause in the UN won support in Washington. Even when Qian\\nQichen, the foreign minister, opted to abstain in the UN vote authorising\\nthe use of force against Iraq, he managed to do this without antagonising\\nthe allies: President Bush agreed to see him on the day following the vote,\\napparently against the advice of advisers. He took the view that China could\\nhave vetoed the resolution.\\nAt the same time, Qian managed to demonstrate through its abstention that\\nChina remains committed to an independent foreign policy, and to its support\\nfor Third World countries. He also preserved China's relationship with Iraq,\\nan important customer for Chinese arms.\\nChina is nevertheless walking a tightrope in its relations with the US,\\nwhich were traumatised following the Tiananmen massacre two years ago. Qian\\nhas said that the war against Iraq was 'a big hegemonist power versus a\\nsmall hegemonist'. The US in turn is harbouring anger over China's extensive\\narms trade with volatile countries in the Middle East.\\nFor China, the Gulf War was not just a striking demonstration of US military\\nmight: it heightened anxiety over the emergence of the US as the single\\ndominant world superpower. There is also a nagging awareness that in the\\npost-Cold War era, the US needs China less than it used to.\\nAmerican keenness to get Japan to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in the\\nPacific - in particular through a larger naval role - also prompts alarm.\\nMemories of Japan as a regional military power are painful still.\\nCloser at hand, conflict looms with the US in the improbably-linked areas of\\ntrade and human rights. Ever since the Tiananmen massacre, the US Congress\\nhas put China's poor human rights record under the microscope. The recent\\nvisit to the US by the Dalai Lama has heightened antagonism.\\nThese issues have become linked with trade ever since Congress opted to use\\nthe annual debate over extension of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to\\ntrading partners as a means of punishing tyrannical governments. China\\nargues that this is an unacceptable intrusion into its internal affairs.\\nUS Congressmen argue in turn that it is an internal US affair whether it\\ngives favourable trading status to a country or not. The fact that China now\\nhas one of the largest visible trade surpluses with the US - more than\\nDollars 10bn last year - only exacerbates the conflict.\\nThe MFN debate starts in earnest early in June. Betting men say that, after\\na bumpy ride, China will regain MFN privileges for another year. To lose\\nthem would inflict immense damage to China's external trade and would savage\\nSino-US relations.\\nChina's response to uncertainties in relations with both the US and the\\nSoviet Union has been to forge new friendships where possible. A recent tour\\nof seven European countries by Qian Qichen was part of such a strategy.\\nImproved relations with India - which have been in deep chill since a short\\nborder war in 1962 - are likely to be symbolised by a visit to Delhi later\\nthis year by Li Peng, China's prime minister. This would be the first visit\\nto the Indian capital by China's head of government since the late Zhou\\nEnlai in 1960.\\nOther significant developments include decisions over the past year by Saudi\\nArabia, Indonesia and Singapore to abandon diplomatic recognition of Taiwan\\nin favour of Peking. These constitute an important breakthrough in China's\\nlong term diplomatic strategy of isolating Taipei. They also reinforce\\nChina's position at the heart of the Third World community of nations, and\\nsymbolise an easing of fears in south east Asia over expansionist communism.\\nThese improvements give much-needed solace as China nurses anxiety over the\\nglobal power balance, but do nothing to alter the country's reflexes in\\ntimes of uncertainty.

The deal is likely to\\nfigure prominently in the visit of Jiang Zemin, China's party leader, to\\nMoscow next month.\\nPeking has seen its relations with the US slide since it put down the\\nstudent demonstrators of Tiananmen in 1989.

       " 'FT911-3450': \"FLEET/NORSTAR Financial Group, the new proprietor of the bankrupt Bank of\\nNew England, is forecasting that BNE will generate annual earnings from\\noperations of about Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m between 1993 and 1995.\\nThe prediction comes less than four months after BNE was declared insolvent\\nand seized by federal regulators in one of the biggest bank failures in US\\nhistory.\\nFleet, the Rhode Island-based bank, tempered yesterday's optimism with the\\nwarning that it expects BNE to post a loss of Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m in the\\nfirst six months after the acquisition and to break even for the first 12\\nmonths.\\nFleet, in partnership with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the New York buy-out\\ninvestment boutique which is one of the most powerful takeover players in\\nthe US, was awarded BNE's assets on Monday.\\nFleet will pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Dollars 125m\\nas a premium, made up of Dollars 100m in preferred stock and Dollars 25m in\\ncash. It will also inject Dollars 500m capital into the failed bank.\\nIn exchange, Fleet will take control of three BNE 'bridge banks', with\\ncombined assets of about Dollars 15bn. To finance the deal, Fleet will raise\\nDollars 683m of new capital, including Dollars 283m to be provided by\\ninvestors advised by KKR.\\nThe FDIC said Fleet's offer was the least costly to the federal bank\\ninsurance fund. However, the FDIC will absorb most of the risk associated\\nwith the commercial property loan losses which drove BNE into liquidation.\\nThe FDIC will assume about Dollars 5.5bn of BNE's problem assets.\\nFleet will also be able to turn any additional problem assets over to the\\nFDIC with minimal penalties during the next three years.\\nMr William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, yesterday said the agency plans to\\nborrow between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 5.5bn from the US Treasury's Federal\\nFinancing Bank (FFB) as a result of resolving the BNE collapse.\\nThis is the first time that the FDIC has taken advantage of changes last\\nyear, authorising it to borrow working capital from the FFB. Mr Seidman said\\nabout Dollars 3bn will be repaid from the sale of assets and about Dollars\\n2bn will be losses.\\nThe FDIC has taken great pains to stress KKR's distance from the deal. It\\ndescribed KKR's involvement as 'a passive investor'. But this one of the\\nfirst times that a group which is not a bank has been allowed to make a\\nsignificant capital infusion into a leading US bank.\\nKKR has been thwarted before in its attempts to invest in financial\\ninstitutions, including its 1989 bid for the failed Texas banks of MCorp.\\nIn the case of the Bank of New England, KKR has already met political\\nopposition from Representative John Dingell, the formidable chairman of the\\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr Dingell warned regulators that a\\njoint KKR-Fleet bid might violate laws which prohibit commercial companies\\nfrom owning banks.\\nUnder the terms of the Fleet deal, KKR investors will buy Dollars 283m of\\ndual convertible preferred stock. This will be convertible into 16.03m\\ncommon shares of Fleet/Norstar at Dollars 17.65 a share in no less than\\nthree years.\\nIn addition, KKR has warrants to buy 6.5m Fleet common shares.\\nOn a fully-diluted basis after Fleet's common offering, KKR's investors will\\nhave about 16 per cent of Fleet's non-voting stock.\\nA KKR spokesman said the firm was attracted to the BNE bid by the strength\\nof Fleet/Norstar's management. Fleet, which was founded 200 years ago and\\nhas assets of Dollars 32.6bn excluding BNE, is considered one of the\\nbest-run New England banks.\\nThe BNE acquisition will transform it into the biggest player in the region.\\nAnalysts said the FDIC's choice of Fleet against competing bids from\\nBankAmerica and Bank of Boston was a compromise decision, which would have\\nthe least ramifications for the US banking industry.\",\n",

But the immediate gain of 17.5 Footsie points,\\nfollowing Mr Lamont's speech to the Institute of Directors, was trimmed\\nlater and trading volume remained disappointing.\\nEquities opened lower, reacting to the further fall of 38 Dow points on Wall\\nStreet overnight. Mr Lamont's statement that UK inflation is falling fast\\nrevived hopes that the next cut in base rates may not be quite so far away\\nas feared; the market's swift response was also fuelled by firmness in stock\\nindex futures.\\nThe stock market topped off fairly quickly, however, also discouraged by\\nnews of a widening in the UK monthly current account trade deficit to Pounds\\n432m in March. A further attempt to move forward when Wall Street opened\\nhigher was checked when the Dow slipped back from its early high to show a\\ngain of about 8 points in London trading hours.\\nThe final London reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,503.8 for a net rise of 13\\npoints. Equity dealers found the recapture of the 2,500 area unconvincing,\\nlargely because turnover was unimpressive.\\nEquity strategists continue to take a cautious view of the near-term outlook\\nfor the equity market. However, UBS Phillips & Drew said there are some\\ngrounds for mild optimism about the UK economy, in spite of 'an exceedingly\\ngrim first quarter'. It warned that political factors could unsettle\\nsterling and hence keep real interest rates high.\\nSeaq volume of 520.6m shares yesterday, against 403m on Monday, was inflated\\nby turnover of 101m shares in Saatchi & Saatchi, comprised largely of a deal\\nof 45m shares in the advertising group, double-counted on Seaq. More\\ndetailed data from the London Stock Exchange indicated that retail, or\\ncustomer, interest in equities continues to fall well below the Pounds 1bn\\ndaily level still seen as the target for the London securities industry to\\ntrade profitably.\\nThe revived uncertainties in the industry were revealed by the decision of\\nBarclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank, to pull out of the US\\nequities market; Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank, disclosed\\nfinancial write-offs in its US arm. However, there was better news on\\nprogress at County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster.\\nThe stock market was also waiting for news on the proposals to merge the\\nLondon Traded Options Market with Liffe, the London International Financial\\nFutures Exchange. The market took on board two more rights issues, the most\\nsignificant being a call for Pounds 162m from Taylor Woodrow, one of\\nBritain's largest housebuilders. The construction and building sector also\\nhad to face a disappointing trading statement from Tarmac.\\nThe blue chip stocks were mostly a shade firmer on the day, responding to\\nthe more optimistic views on inflation rather than to yesterday's moves by\\ncentral banks to sell the US dollar.

The Seaq ticker indicated that the transaction price was 19p. Saatchi\\nshares firmed  1/2 to 20 1/2 p.\\nThe level of business drew attention to a 9.1 per cent stake held by a group\\nincluding ESL Partners, a Dallas-based finance house, and Mr Lawrence Tisch,\\nthe chief executive of CBS, the US media company. This group underwrote part\\nof Saatchi's rights issue, which was completed last week.\\nSince the rights issue was not registered under US securities laws, ESL\\n(which had a large block of Europreference stock) has entered into a private\\nagreement with Saatchi to buy 52.6m shares at the rights price of 10p. In\\naddition, on Monday the group acquired 90.1m Saatchi shares in exchange for\\n25.8m redeemable preference shares.\\nIn spite of much speculation to the contrary, traders and analysts close to\\nthe company concluded that the 45m-share block and ESL's agreement were\\nunrelated. With over 1 1/2 bn Saatchi shares now in issue, more high levels\\nof turnover are likely.\\nBuilding news\\nThere were three big developments in the building sector: the unexpected\\nPounds 162.4m rights issue from Taylor Woodrow, a steep decline in profits\\nat Tarmac, and news that Beazer, the construction and aggregates group,\\nplans to spin off its UK and European businesses.\\nTaylor Woodrow's rights issue, a one-for-four at 200p, came as a surprise to\\nthe market, which responded by marking the shares down to 239p. After the\\ninitial reaction, the stock staged a rally, eventually closing only 2 off at\\n251p. Specialists said institutions had indicated they would support the\\nissue because Taylor Woodrow is seen to be one of the best-managed companies\\nin the construction area.\\nTarmac's preliminary profits - Pounds 190.7m against Pounds 377m - were in\\nline with expectations but did only minimal damage to the share price. What\\ndid hurt the stock was a gloomy post-figures meeting with analysts, who were\\ntold that the first half of the current year had begun badly in both the UK\\nand the US.\\nBig profits downgrades were instigated, with Panmure Gordon cutting its\\ncurrent year number from Pounds 190m to Pounds 125m. Tarmac shares were\\nheavily traded (9.5m) and closed 16 off at 229p.\\nBeazer settled 4 higher at 185p on 2.5m, with specialists quick to point out\\nthe company's 20 per cent market outperformance over the last month, 68 per\\ncent over the last three months and 13 per cent over the last year.\\nBET upgraded\\nBusiness services group BET was driven higher by two reports yesterday. The\\none that could be confirmed was that UBS Phillips & Drew had upgraded the\\nstock to a trading buy.\\nThe broker said that with the likely sale of its Biffa waste management\\noperation, the dividend could be held and investors should buy for the high\\nyield. The second story suggested that a buyer had already been found for\\nBiffa.\\nMr Bob Carpenter of Kleinwort Benson had expected the shares to recover as\\nbuyers were drawn by the very generous return for a FT-SE Index stock. BET\\nshares rose to 169p before ending 7 ahead on balance at 167p on turnover of\\n2.2m shares.\\nCannon Street up\\nThe refinancing operation proposed by Cannon Street Investments (CSI), the\\nconglomerate, received an overwhelming vote of approval and the shares\\nresponded strongly. Analysts backed the judgment, saying the raising of\\nPounds 46.7m net through a rights issue and placing of convertible\\npreference stock seemed to be a very sensible move.\\nIt removes a problem, they said, by transforming gearing from 400 per cent\\nto 82 per cent. CSI annual profits were lower, as expected, but the dividend\\ndistribution was maintained. The shares closed at a 1991 high of 124p, up\\n18.\\nSmithKline Beecham continued to retreat on light profit-taking, not helped\\nby Nikko Securities' conclusion that investors had done enough switching\\nfrom Glaxo. The former slipped 5 to 817p and Glaxo added 4 at 1076p. Before\\nyesterday's fall, SmithKline had gained more than 10 per cent in a month,\\nmaking it the fourth best performer in the FT-SE 100 over that period.\\nFisons, down 5 at 469p, also felt the force of profit-takers in spite of\\nnews that Merck, the world's biggest drug company, had ended research on a\\npotential rival to Fisons' asthma treatments. At its annual meeting\\nyesterday, Merck announced the abandonment of Venzair, a drug it had once\\nforecast would become first line therapy for asthma.\\nThe market has been concerned that Fisons was vulnerable to new developments\\nin the field. 'Venzair would certainly have worried Fisons,' said one\\nanalyst.\\nThe prospect of first-quarter figures tomorrow from ICI continued to\\nunsettle trading in the stock. The price slipped 5 in early trading, then\\nrecovered its composure to peak at 1089p before easing once again. It ended\\nat 1083p, up just 3 on the day. Turnover was a solid 1.5m shares.\\nThe bullish sentiment in the oil sector - a rising crude oil price coupled\\nwith the recent strength of the dollar - continued to drive oil shares\\nhigher. Aiding the latest upward move by the oils was a sharp improvement in\\nfirst-quarter earnings at Mobil, the US oil group.\\nThe heaviest turnover in the sector, 5m shares, was in BP, which moved up 5\\nto 354p, closely followed by Shell, 4.9m, which climbed 9 1/2 to 522 1/2 p.\\nThe latter was boosted by the oil team at Hoare Govett, whose latest Oil\\nMonthly reiterated its positive stance on the sector, and focused especially\\non Shell, which it views as the prime beneficiary of record downstream\\nmargins in the Far East.\\nThe Water Package came under another barrage of selling pressure and closed\\naround the day's lowest, down 23 at Pounds 2945, as more institutions, both\\nin London and abroad, sold their holdings or unravelled the Package units.\\n'This market is still extremely vulnerable and we expect this to continue at\\nleast up until the local elections,' said one trader, in a reference to the\\nLabour party's policy of renationalising the water industry if it wins the\\nnext general election.\\nThe electricity companies, on the other hand, responded to positive\\nrecommendations from investment analysts, with Manweb and South Wales\\nheavily bought after being highlighted by one of the big US investment\\nhouses. Manweb advanced 13 to 248p and South Wales 10 to 240p.\\nA late downward move by British Steel was attributed to a profits\\ndowngrading by Smith New Court. The shares held steady until the last hour\\nof trading, when they turned off to close 2 1/2 down at 135p.\\nJ. Sainsbury recovered from an early loss to close a penny better on balance\\nat 364p as the market pondered the company's decision to redeem a Pounds\\n150m bond convertible into preference shares. The rise in the share price\\nhad already prompted some bond holders to convert and so the announcement by\\nSainsbury did not take the market completely by surprise.\\nHammerson continued to benefit from last week's figures, subsequent buy\\nrecommendations from analysts and presentations to institutions. The shares\\nwere 16 stronger at one point before closing a net 9 to the good at 639p.\\nVolume was above average for the stock at 545,000.\\nMcKechnie, the industrial components group, slipped 6 to 291p as analysts\\nadjusted full year profits estimates in the wake of lower first-half\\nrevenue. The setback was no surprise but researchers still erred on the side\\nof caution, with Mr Matthew Sutherland of County NatWest moving to Pounds\\n23m from Pounds 25m.\\nBad sentiment from Monday's profits downgradings continued to unsettle\\nGestetner, the office equipment and photographic products group, and the\\nclose was down 6 further at 207p.\\nNEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991\\nNEW HIGHS (171).\\nBRITISH FUNDS (4) Treas. 8pc '91, Treas. 3pc '92, Treas.

Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, chairman of the\\ngroup's Central Selling Organisation, argues that if Botswana chose not to\\nsell its production exclusively through his organisation, the CSO's ability\\nto regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be compromised.\\nHe said: 'Because the major (diamond) producers freely consent to sell\\nexclusively through one channel, the CSO is able to preserve an orderly\\nmarket by matching rough diamond sales closely to consumer demand.'\\nHowever, IDC (Holdings), a London-based group which claims to be the most\\nexperienced and substantial dealer in rough diamonds independent of the CSO,\\nsuggests the CSO's attitude 'is unreasonable and based on a conceptual\\nargument with little substance in fact.'\\nIn presentations to Botswana's Minerals Policy Committee and members of\\nparliament, IDC has been arguing that, not only was it commercially\\nessential for Botswana to understand the real value of its diamond output,\\nbut that the country had a political responsibility to do so.\\n'Data accumulated independently of the CSO would put Botswana in a position\\nto have more input into the arrangements for the sale of its diamonds,' IDC\\npointed out. 'On a political level this would enable the government to\\nanswer its critics or its electors with confidence and sure knowledge when\\nquestioned about arrangements for the disposal of the country's mineral\\nassets.'\\nIf Botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production, worth\\nabout USDollars 100m, independently of the CSO - which sells about Dollars\\n4bn-worth a year from all over the world - it would represent no threat to\\nmarket stability, IDC said.\\nIt claims analysts have estimated that 50 per cent of De Beers' diamond\\nprofits in 1989 came from Botswana. 'This profit is disproportionate to the\\nsale of diamonds by Debswana (De Beers' subsidiary in Botswana) to the CSO\\nas a percentage of the CSO's total sales profits,' IDC says.\\n'It is not unreasonable to reflect whether the fact that Botswana is the\\nonly major producer currently selling 100 per cent of its production to the\\nCSO has any bearing on the substantial profits made by the CSO on the sale\\nof its diamonds.'\\nOther substantial producers such as the Soviet Union, Angola, Zaire and\\nAustralia do not sell all their production to the CSO and therefore have\\naccess to independent market information.\\nIDC does have a vested interest. It already markets diamonds for producers\\nin Guinea, Guyana, Brazil and the Central African Republic, and is offering\\nto do some marketing for Botswana.\\nIt acknowledges that all sectors of the diamond trade welcomed the CSO's\\nefforts to keep the diamond market stable. But 'the fact that the CSO forms\\npart of an aggressive, profit-motivated public company with a primary\\nresponsibility to its shareholders is often lost from view.'\\nDe Beers says Botswana diamonds do not contribute half its diamond account\\nprofits - but it will not divulge the true figure.\\nIt suggests IDC's arguments are flawed because they are based on an\\nassumption that Botswana needs more market information. However, in common\\nwith other producers selling diamonds to the CSO, Botswana has appointed\\nindependent valuers who continuously monitor diamond production and the\\nprices paid.\\nAccording to the CSO, these valuers are fully informed about market\\nconditions and the prices received for Botswana stones.\\nMr Geoffrey Leggett at IDC suggests, however, the valuer only ensures that\\nthe assortment of diamonds from Botswana conforms to an agreed sample and\\nthat the agreed contract price is paid. 'He is not a trader, he does not\\nknow what the stones are worth in the market.'\\nDe Beers insists it remains on cordial terms with Botswana and says the\\ncountry is still selling its diamonds through the CSO. It is not the first\\ntime that contract negotiations have gone on past the theoretical deadline.\\nThe Botswana government recently set up a diamond cutting centre with De\\nBeers' technical help, and this, too, should further the country's\\nunderstanding of the market.\\nThere has been a special relationship between the CSO and Botswana since\\n1987 when the country sold its diamond stockpile to De Beers in exchange for\\nan estimated USDollars 250m and a 5.27 per cent shareholding in the South\\nAfrican group.\\nAnalysts suggest market conditions do not help Botswana press its case. De\\nBeers, which itself mines about 40 per cent of the world's annual rough\\ndiamond output, markets stones from Angola, Australia, Namibia, Tanzania,\\nZaire and the Soviet Union, as well as South Africa and Botswana.\\nPrices of rough diamonds, with few exceptions, have moved upwards every year\\nsince the 1930s depression. But now De Beers is steering the world's most\\nsuccessful cartel through depressed market conditions caused by the\\nrecession in the US (the biggest single market for diamonds), sogginess in\\nJapan (the second-largest), and the Gulf war.\\nTo maintain price stability, the CSO is stockpiling diamonds at great\\nexpense, rather than releasing unwanted stones to the market. Its\\npromotional budget has been lifted by 20 per cent to more than Dollars 1m a\\nweek - Dollars 53m for the year.\\nIn addition, Botswana this year faces its first budgetary deficit since 1982\\nand, according to De Beers' calculations, one of its diamond mines  - Orapa\\n -needs investment of USDollars 600m.\\nThe CSO has also notched up some recent coups: bringing a big part of the\\nSoviet Union's and Angola's rough diamond output back into the cartel - or\\nwhat it calls its 'single channel marketing' - arrangements.\\nHowever, the CSO is also currently involved in contract negotiations with\\nArgyle Diamonds, the western Australian company which is the biggest\\nindividual diamond producer in volume (but only sixth in value) terms.\\nArgyle, too, wants to stay with the CSO when its contract ends on May 1 -\\nbut on more favourable terms.\\nA delegation from Botswana is to meet CSO representatives in London at the\\nend of this month for another attempt to break the deadlock. The industry is\\nbetting that Botswana will give way, perhaps in return for De Beers helping\\nto finance the Orapa mine investment. However, the 'market window' idea is\\nunlikely to be dropped and will almost certainly be raised again when the\\nnext contract negotiations start.\",\n",

       " 'FT911-3494': \"Imagine gears clashing, the engine sputtering and the car stalling. That is\\nthe picture some observers paint of the credit crunch and its impact on the\\nUS economy. 'Get credit flowing again,' would seem the remedy. If bank\\ncapital requirements stand in the way, reduce them, so that banks can lend\\nagain.\\nSuch a prescription makes no sense. It is the wrong response to the wrong\\nissue. Less capital is not better. Nor is more capital. What is needed is a\\nfranchise that will improve banks' ability to attract capital and capital\\nrequirements that are market-based.\\nThe so-called credit crunch is no reason to reduce bank capital\\nrequirements. Borrowers with the same prospective cash flows and financial\\nratios as a year ago are getting credit, either from banks or in the capital\\nmarkets. For them there is no credit crunch.\\nThe problem is that borrowers by and large do not have the same financial\\nratios as they did a year ago. The recession has reduced their cash flows.\\nConsequently, the risk of lending has increased. Companies rated A a year\\nago and B today are finding it difficult to obtain the same amount of credit\\nat the same rate as they did a year ago. This may be a 'credit crunch', but,\\nif so, it is more a symptom than a cause of the recession. To imply that\\nbanks should be supplying credit to such borrowers as if nothing had changed\\nis in effect a recommendation that banks should be less prudent. That is\\nunlikely to do either the economy or the banking system any good.\\nThe remedy for recession lies elsewhere. Political uncertainty contributed\\nto the downturn; its removal via the swift victory in the Gulf will\\ncontribute to the upturn. Further stimulus has come through monetary and\\nfiscal policy. Most forecasters now expect the recession to end sometime\\nthis year. This should spell the end of the credit crunch.\\nTo perform their function as financial intermediaries banks need a franchise\\nthat will attract capital. Such a franchise would allow banks to branch\\nfreely and to offer customers a full range of financial services, including\\nsecurities and insurance as well as deposit-taking and lending. This allows\\nbanks to diversify their sources of income, to make more efficient use of\\ntheir distribution systems and to realise economies of scale. The EC has\\ngiven its banks such a franchise through the Second Banking Directive. The\\nUS and Japan are lagging behind, although adoption of the recent US Treasury\\nproposal would help close that gap.\\nThe purpose of bank capital requirements is to limit the risk that a bank\\nwill fail. To do so efficiently such requirements should be market-based.\\nThis means putting investors in debt of banks (and of companies, such as\\nCiticorp, that own banks) at risk so that they will exercise market\\ndiscipline over the bank, and it means relating required capital ratios to\\nthe market risks a bank assumes.\\nIf investors in a company's debt believe that they are at risk when the\\norganisation becomes illiquid or insolvent, they will effectively control\\nthe level of capital that the organisation must maintain. As the perceived\\nlevel of risk increases, such investors generally (and quickly) reduce the\\namount of funds that they are willing to provide and/or demand an increase\\nin the rate of return. To counteract this the company must take steps to\\nimprove its equity ratios.\\nCiticorp's own experience is a case in point. During the past year investors\\nand rating agencies perceived that the risk of Citicorp paper had increased.\\nAs a result, Citicorp had to pay higher rates for certain types of funding\\nand it encountered some difficulty in placing as much paper as it would have\\nliked. We responded by initiating a programme to increase our total capital\\nby Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn over the next three years. The first tranche\\nof the capital increase has come through the issuance of Dollars 1.25bn in\\nconvertible preferred stock. A second tranche will come through the sale of\\nnon-strategic businesses. The rest should come through retained earnings; to\\nthis end we aim to pare costs by Dollars 1.5bn a year while retaining our\\nrevenue momentum. With tight control over asset growth, this\\ncapital-building programme will improve Citicorp's capital ratios.\\nIn designing capital regulation, policymakers should preserve such market\\ndiscipline. This entails limiting the guarantees that the government\\nprovides to depositors or creditors of banks and companies that own banks.\\nFortunately, both the US and the EC seem ready to do so. The US is\\ndiscussing ways to limit insurance of bank deposits, and the EC seems\\ndetermined to keep coverage low.\\nHowever, limiting guarantees is only the first step. Capital requirements\\nshould be imposed on the bank (but not on companies that own banks) and\\nthese requirements should be related to the bank's exposure to market risks,\\nsuch as interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and credit risk. The bank's\\nexposure to each risk is its net position (after due allowance for netting,\\nhedging and diversification) times the likely movement in the risk factor,\\nsuch as the level of interest rates. The bank's overall capital requirement\\nwould be the sum of the requirements for each risk, minus an allowance for\\nthe fact that some risks (such as interest and exchange rate risk) may\\nthemselves be negatively correlated.\\nElements of this market-based approach are present in the EC's proposed\\nCapital Adequacy Directive (CAD). This directive would apply to non-bank\\ninvestment firms and to the trading book of banks. For the bank's trading\\nbook, the CAD would replace the 8 per cent Basle ratio with separate\\nrequirements for credit risk, interest rate risk and exchange rate risk. The\\nCAD holds the promise of establishing a capital regime that will protect\\nboth bank and non-bank investment firms while creating a level playing field\\non which the two would compete.\\nIn sum, the credit crunch will pass. Bank regulators need not act. But they\\nmust act to give banks a franchise that will attract capital. And they must\\nact to make capital requirements market-based.\\nThe author is vice-chairman of Citicorp/Citibank\",\n",

They would do well to look to Asia as well.\\nAdvice to eastern Europe from western experts largely follows classical\\neconomic lines: free prices, remove subsidies, open your economies to\\ninternational trade, make your currencies freely convertible, privatise the\\nstate-owned companies, invite foreign investment, close inefficient plants\\nand retire redundant workers. This, the experts acknowledge, will involve\\nsome costs - higher prices, unemployment, lost income, and more foreign debt\\nand servicing. But these are short-term and will be more than offset by the\\nlonger-term benefits that accrue from free markets. They urge, therefore,\\nthat their recommended reform package be adopted quickly and in full, while\\nsupporters of economic change still hold the high ground.\\nInitially, east Europe's economic reformers assumed that advice about\\nmarkets from advisers schooled in market economies could not be wrong. More\\nrecently, however, the first rush of enthusiasm for a cold-turkey approach\\nto reform is fading. Euphoria over economic emancipation is giving way to a\\nmore hard-headed assessment of the people and institutional deficits that\\nwill have to be cleared before eastern Europe's economies can survive - much\\nless compete - in a free-market world.\\nThe deficits are formidable: most of the basic skills and institutions\\nneeded to make a system work - double-entry book-keeping, personal property\\nrights and a commercial banking system, to name a few - do not exist.\\nIndustrial equipment and technology are, by western standards, obsolete. Few\\ncompanies can estimate their net worth or unit production costs, or judge\\nwhat they could produce competitively - information all serious foreign\\ninvestors would insist on. Arching over these deficits are the problems of\\nsevere environmental degradation, long-neglected infrastructure and the\\nvirtual disappearance of the region's pre-war ethic.\\nIncreased awareness of their economies' internal weaknesses, together with\\ndoubts about continued public support for a reform process that involves\\nhardships of unknown magnitude and unpredictable duration, are raising\\nsecond thoughts among eastern Europe's leaders about the wisdom of exposing\\ntheir still-fragile democracies to what amounts to an economic free-fall.\\nOther factors have surfaced as well that reinforce the need for a second\\nlook. The recent rout of agricultural subsidies by the General Agreement on\\nTariffs and Trade and the continuing row between the US and Japan over\\nmarket access, for example, suggest that the free-market approach\\nrecommended for eastern Europe is honoured as much in the breach as in the\\nobservance by the market-oriented countries of the west.\\nA further discovery is that the path to the market being urged on east\\nEuropean countries is substantially different to that taken by countries\\nthat have most recently successfully navigated the course from economic\\nbackwardness to world-class competitors. These, of course, are Asia's Newly\\nIndustrialised Countries (NICs): Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.\\nMany cultural, political and social differences separate east Europe from\\neast Asia, and comparisons should not be pushed too far. But in terms of how\\nto go about transforming a backward economy into an efficient, competitive\\none, there is much common ground and many lessons to be shared. A few\\nexamples of the differences in the approach recommended to eastern Europe\\nand the way that NICs, and earlier, Japan, went about the work of economic\\nreform and restructuring are perhaps instructive:\\nIndustrial strategy and support: Neither Asia's NICs nor Japan entrusted to\\nthe market, or to foreign investors, responsibility for deciding which of\\ntheir industries would prosper and which would fail. On the contrary, they\\nformulated industrial strategies based on forecasts of market developments\\nand assessments of which of their 'neo-infant industries' could be expected\\nto carve out a competitive niche in world markets and which could not. For\\nthe first group, they provided protection from import competition as well as\\nexport incentives, tax relief and other financial help to bolster their\\ngrowth and competitiveness.\\nTo ensure that the beneficiary industries would not become\\nprotection-dependent and would become internationally competitive over time,\\nfiscal support was provided on a declining scale. At the same time,\\ncompanies in uncompetitive or declining industries were helped to diversify\\nor phase out, and workers retrained.\\nEastern Europe, after 40 years of disastrous economic planning,\\nunderstandably eschews all forms of central planning, including Asia's\\nmarket-directed, indicative type. The same attitudes carry over to the\\nquestion of transitional help for industries trying to adapt to market\\nforces. While these attitudes are consistent with a free-market philosophy,\\nAsia's less doctrinaire approach might save some east European companies\\nthat with reasonable transitional support could adjust to a market\\nenvironment, but without it would likely go under - taking jobs and income\\nwith them.\\nExchange rates: Asian countries have used exchange rates as an important\\ntool of economic policy. As typified by Korea and Taiwan, exchange rates\\nwere set to encourage exports and savings and discourage imports. Only after\\nexports had penetrated big overseas markets - and they had amassed large\\nreserves in the process - did these countries agree (reluctantly) to a\\nrevaluation of their currencies.\\nEast European countries are being advised to do the opposite: let the market\\ndetermine the volumes of imports and exports and, by default, set the\\nmarket-clearing exchange rate.\\nForeign investment: Japan earlier, and the NICs more recently, have acquired\\nmuch of their technology through licences, franchises, market-sharing\\narrangements and reverse engineering (Asian for 'pirating'). They wanted\\nknowledge and technology, not foreign partners, and foreign equity\\ninvestment was (and is) not actively encouraged. During Japan's first period\\nof modernisation in the 1860s, Japan imported European bankers - but not\\ntheir banks - to help create a domestic banking system. When enough Japanese\\nhad learned to be bankers, the foreign advisers were sent home. The NICs\\nhave adopted an essentially similar technique. Price liberalisation and\\nsubsidies: Prices in Asia's NICs are nominally set by market forces. But key\\nprices may be adjusted further by fiscal means (tax rebates, tariffs,\\nduties, subsidies) to ensure that the buy/sell, save/invest signals they\\nemit conform to national priorities: high savings and investment rates,\\naggressive exporting and relative self-sufficiency in food. It is\\nincongruous that while east European countries are being urged to let market\\nforces determine their domestic prices, there is no market price for\\nimported rice in Japan - because there is no imported rice; and agricultural\\nprices in the US and Europe are influenced as much by national budgets as by\\nmarket forces.\\nA final consideration. It is axiomatic that public support for economic\\nreform is inversely proportionate to the distress it causes. Common to both\\nAsia's and eastern Europe's economic restructuring efforts is the need to\\nenlist and maintain public support for the reform process. Asia's NICs have\\ndemonstrated that it is possible to achieve market-driven economic\\nrestructuring without incurring unacceptably high economic and social costs.\\nEastern Europe's economic reformers might find it rewarding to take a closer\\nlook at Asia's experience.\\nThe author was vice-president of the Asian Development Bank from 1978 to\\n1990 and is currently a consultant to the European Bank for Reconstruction\\nand Development.\",\n",

The process of fundamental political reform is difficult enough\\nat the best of times. It is especially hazardous when times are hard.\\nNow that the irreversibility of change in South Africa is so clearly\\napparent, the least western governments can do to improve the economic\\nclimate is to hasten the end of remaining sanctions. And the African\\nNational Congress, still fighting a last-ditch battle against repeal, should\\ninstead acknowledge that sanctions have achieved their purpose, declare\\nvictory and withdraw.\\nAs President F. W. de Klerk has pointed out during his visit to London, the\\ncombination of population growth of 2.6 per cent a year, and an average\\nannual growth rate over the last decade of 1.6 per cent, makes a grim\\nbackdrop to the constitutional process now under way in South Africa.\\nThere is a danger that this process can be derailed by the violence that\\nwracks the country; and while political tensions are at the heart of the\\nfighting, there is little doubt that these tensions are exacerbated by\\npoverty and rising unemployment.\\nMr de Klerk is thus right to argue that economic growth and constitutional\\nreform have to be mutually reinforcing. The lifting of sanctions combined\\nwith new investment is an essential condition to South Africa's economic\\nrecovery, which in turn is critical to growth in the whole region.\\nConflicting signals\\nUnfortunately there continue to be conflicting signals from South Africa. Mr\\nNelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, due in\\nLondon today, can be expected to persist in the ANC's view that it is too\\nsoon to lift trade and other embargoes against Pretoria, arguing that\\ncontinued outside pressure is needed if Mr de Klerk is to fulfil his pledge\\nto create a non-racial South Africa.\\nThis argument held good until Mr de Klerk so convincingly demonstrated his\\ncommitment to reform. But by the end of June the last pillars of apartheid\\nwill have been repealed - the Group Areas Act, the Land Acts, and the racial\\nprovisions of the Population Registration Act.\\nEven if the government wanted to, it could not now rebuild apartheid. The\\ninternal pressures that brought about the system's demise - demographic\\nchanges, the growth of black trade unions, the increasing importance of\\nblack consumers, shortages of white skilled manpower - are as powerful as\\never.\\nMeanwhile the new constitution for South Africa is slowly starting to take\\nshape. The ANC's draft constitutional principles, published earlier this\\nmonth, revealed encouraging common ground with Pretoria. Both parties\\npropose a bill of rights, proportional representation, and a bi-cameral\\nassembly.\\nSticking points\\nOn the face of it, the ANC demand that the constitution be drawn up by a\\nconstituent assembly, and its call for an interim government, are sticking\\npoints in the transition process. But there are signs that a compromise may\\nbe possible. Pretoria has indicated that once the multi-party conference,\\nexpected to convene later this year, has reached agreement on the principles\\nof the new constitution, they could be placed before a multi-party\\nconference instead of a constituent assembly.\\nAnd yesterday in London Mr de Klerk went some way towards meeting the ANC's\\ncall for an interim government, offering all main political leaders 'a voice\\nin the formulation of important policy decisions' during the period leading\\nto a new constitution.\\nThese developments should encourage the business community whose support Mr\\nde Klerk has been seeking during his visit to London. Of course, Mr de Klerk\\nmust convince would-be investors that the violence that continues to scar\\nthe country will soon be brought to an end. But they can play an important\\npart in bringing this about by taking an important role in the building of a\\nnew South Africa.\",\n",

But as one crisis meeting succeeds another this week,\\none could be forgiven for thinking that the industry is slipping back into\\nthe dark days of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\\nThe chief executives of Rover, Ford of Britain, Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot\\ntroop into the Treasury today to tell Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of\\ntheir deep concern at what they see as an attack on car manufacturing in\\nlast month's Budget.\\nTomorrow union leaders have been called to talks with Mr Albert Caspers,\\nFord of Europe's director for manufacturing operations, amid speculation -\\nstrenuously denied by Ford itself - that the future of the US car maker's\\nBritish assembly plants at Halewood, Merseyside and Dagenham in Essex, is\\nagain in doubt.\\nYet the paradoxical fact is that more car assembly capacity is under\\nconstruction in Britain than anywhere else in Europe. By the mid-1990s\\noutput is forecast to be more than double the crisis level of the early\\n1980s. As the Japanese car makers march in, component suppliers that have\\npreviously shunned manufacturing in the UK are buzzing towards the\\nhoney-pot.\\nThe script looked promising, but for the moment the plot appears to be going\\nbadly awry.\\nAfter five successive record years from 1985 to 1989 UK new car sales have\\nfallen ominously. Registrations last year were down by 12.7 per cent -\\nadmittedly from a record level - and have plunged by a further 21.6 per cent\\nin the first quarter.\\nHighly indebted car dealers - reputable groups as well as fringe operators -\\nare collapsing into receivership and liquidation in worrying numbers.\\nLeading component makers are suffering sharply falling profits and\\nworkforces are being cut. 'The current climate is hostile and in many of our\\nmarkets customer demand is erratic and uncertain,' says Mr Colin Hope,\\nchairman of T&N, a leading UK auto components maker.\\nTruck sales are only half the level of two years ago and the slide into\\nrecession is sharper than any UK truck maker can remember in the post-war\\nperiod. 'Heaven only knows how some manufacturers are surviving,' says Mr\\nPeter Foden, chairman of ERF, the last publicly-quoted, independent UK truck\\nmaker. Most UK truck makers are running up big losses, and short-time\\nworking and redundancies have been the order of the day for more than a\\nyear.\\nAgainst a background of such immediate traumas Mr Derek Barron, chairman of\\nFord of Britain and president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and\\nTraders, Mr George Simpson, chief executive of Rover, Mr Paul Tosch,\\nchairman of Vauxhall, and Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director of Peugeot\\nTalbot, will seek to convince the chancellor that he has kicked the industry\\nwhen it was already down.\\nAs the economic cycle turned down, they had been looking to the government\\nfor support and encouragement in the attempt to make the industry a driving\\nforce again in the UK economy. Instead, in a Budget principally designed to\\nextricate the government from the poll tax debacle, the industry was hit by\\nhigher value added tax - but no relief in the discriminatory special car tax\\n -fuel tax increases and scale charge increases for company car benefits\\nabove the level of inflation, and the imposition on employers of national\\ninsurance contributions on company cars.\\nThe motor industry worries that the government is looking to it for a quick\\nfiscal fix. Memories run deep of the 1950s and 1960s, when the government\\nsought to regulate the economy in part through car hire purchase controls.\\n'The industry wants reassurance that this is not the beginning of it being\\nused again as an economic regulator,' says Professor Garel Rhys, professor\\nof motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School and adviser to the\\nCommons trade and industry select committee.\\nAbove all the car makers are seeking a cut in the 10 per cent rate of\\nspecial car tax. The industry argues that no other leading vehicle producing\\ncountry in Europe singles out cars for such a discriminatory levy as the\\nspecial car tax.\\nThis year is probably already a lost cause for the industry - the latest\\nforecasts suggest car sales will struggle to exceed 1.6m-1.7m units and\\ntruck sales could hit the lowest level for decades.\\nNevertheless, the worst fears of the industry chiefs may well turn out to be\\nonly short-term; Britain could still prove to be one of the strongest growth\\nareas of the 1990s in the world auto industry.\\nThe current recession is certainly causing painful job losses beyond the\\nlabour force reductions of an industry seeking greater productivity and\\nefficiency. But the deepest and most painful restructuring moves were\\nalready achieved in the 1980s.\\nA report by the Institute of Manpower Studies showed that from 1980 to 1987\\nthe UK vehicles and parts industry had shed 185,000 jobs, or 45 per cent of\\nthe workforce at the start of the decade. In the same period labour\\nproductivity rose 66 per cent.\\nProfits certainly fell last year at Vauxhall, Peugeot Talbot and Rover. At\\nFord of Britain, they fell sharply: the company was hit by industrial action\\nlast year and is now also carrying the heavy losses of Jaguar, the UK luxury\\ncar maker it acquired at the end of 1989. But that is a far cry from the sea\\nof red ink in which the industry fought to stay afloat a decade ago. It is\\naltogether leaner and fitter now.\\n'The UK is probably top middle in productivity in Europe,' says Prof Rhys,\\n'way behind Germany, probably behind Spain, but perhaps ahead of France. But\\nwhat saves the UK is its relatively low wages. With middling productivity\\nand the lowest wages, the UK has one of the best cost bases in Europe.'\\nWage costs in the UK motor industry last year were the lowest among all the\\nworld's leading automobile-producing countries, according to statistics\\ncompiled by the German Automobile Industry Federation (VDA).\\nSome assembly capacity in the UK still has to be closed - most notably part\\nof Rover's Cowley, Oxford plant - but the accent in the 1990s, at least in\\nthe car and components sectors, should be firmly on expansion. According to\\nProf Rhys an optimistic forecast would suggest a leap in UK car assembly\\ncapacity from 1.7m in 1989 to 2.7m-2.8m by the end of the decade.\\nIt is the motor industry in Britain that will be growing, however, not the\\nBritish motor industry. In terms of ownership precious little of the latter\\nremains. What is transforming the sector's prospects is the wave of inward\\ninvestment by Japanese car makers into the UK.\\nThe decisions by Nissan, Toyota and Honda to begin car production in the UK\\nappear to guarantee that output in the second half of the 1990s will exceed\\n2m cars a year, more than double the level of the first half of the 1980s,\\nand the build-up of production promises eventual relief for the sector's\\nchronic trade deficit.\\nTo Mr Jacques Calvet, chief executive of France's Peugeot group and\\nphilosopher-king of the lobby to restrict Japanese car sales in Europe, the\\nUK is fast becoming a 'Japanese aircraft carrier off the coast of Europe,'\\nand 'Japan's fifth-largest island'.\\nThe alarming trend of UK car sales, imports and production in the 1970s and\\n1980s explains at a glance, however, why the government has welcomed\\nJapanese car makers to Britain so enthusiastically.\\nSince 1983 the UK balance of payments has shown a deficit on manufactured\\ngoods - and the motor industry has played a key role in the slump. The motor\\nindustry trade balance has deteriorated sharply since the end of the 1970s\\nand been firmly in deficit since 1982. In recent years it has accounted for\\nclose to a third of the total UK visible trade deficit.\\nThe first relief came last year, as the deficit fell to Pounds 4.6bn from\\nPounds 6.6bn in 1989. The biggest factor in the improvement was the impact\\nof the recession, however, which cut imports as new car sales fell.\\nNow there are also the first signs of structural improvement, as UK car\\nexports begin to grow appreciably. Export programmes by Vauxhall, Ford and\\nPeugeot have been important. But for the first time exports by Nissan are\\nalso having a significant impact and this year Nissan begins to export cars\\nto Japan from the UK.\\nThe drama of the fluctuations in the fortunes of motor manufacturing in the\\nUK can hardly be overstated.\\nFrom the early 1930s to 1955 the UK had Europe's largest motor industry. It\\nis currently ninth in the world production league and fifth in Europe behind\\nWest Germany, France, Italy and Spain.\\nIn 1968 when the UK-owned industry combined its forces to form the British\\nLeyland Motor Corporation, the company accounted for 40 per cent of UK new\\ncar registrations. Today the rump company that remains from British Leyland,\\nRover Group, is 20 per cent owned by Honda of Japan, and last year it held\\n14 per cent of UK new car sales.\\nCompare that with the rise of the Japanese. Back in 1952 Nissan was\\nproducing Austin cars in Japan under licence from Austin Motor, and Honda\\ndid not even market its first car until 1963. It now appears a racing\\ncertainty that by the second half of the 1990s Japanese car makers will\\naccount directly for about a third of UK car production of about 2m units a\\nyear.\\nAnother third may be European-owned with Peugeot of France producing at\\nRyton, Coventry, possibly with an enhanced capacity, and Rover Group at\\nleast nominally UK-owned. Rover is already importantly dependent on Honda\\ntechnology, however, in addition to its minority ownership.\\nThe remaining third of the UK car production base will be US-owned, with\\nFord also controlling Jaguar and Aston Martin and General Motors (Vauxhall),\\nLotus.\\nWith total planned investments of more than Pounds 1.8bn the Japanese are\\nnow committed to closing the yawning gap between UK car production of 1.296m\\nlast year and domestic car sales of 2.009m:\\nNissan will build more than 200,000 cars a year at its Pounds 700m\\nSunderland plant by 1992-93. Output totalled 76,000 last year and is\\nexpected to reach 120,000 this year with 80 per cent earmarked for export.\\nNissan is also investing in UK R&D facilities.\\nToyota is committed to building 100,000 cars a year by late 1995 rising to\\n200,000 cars a year by 1997-98 at Burnaston, near Derby, but this timetable\\ncould well be brought forward. It is investing Pounds 840m in car assembly\\nand engine plants.\\nHonda is committed to building 100,000 cars a year by 1994 at its Pounds\\n350m Swindon assembly and engine plant. Rover is producing up to 40,000\\nHonda Concertos a year at its Longbridge Birmingham plant.\\nNissan has indicated its ambition to expand to a capacity of 400,000 cars a\\nyear by the late 1990s, and both Toyota and Honda are expected to expand\\nsignificantly beyond their present publicly declared targets.\\nThe next time a chancellor attacks the UK motor industry, the deputation on\\nhis doorstep may well include Nissan, Toyota and Honda as well as Ford,\\nVauxhall, Rover and Peugeot.\",\n",

Both features\\nlook sensible.\\nThe detail of the proposed tax is subject to two main criticisms: first,\\nthat increases in tax bills are not proportionate to increases in the value\\nof the properties; second, that it retains the head tax element, in the form\\nof the 25 per cent personal discount for single adult households. But once\\none has abandoned the myth that each individual adult must receive an\\nindividual bill, for the sake of accountability, the latter element is\\nhardly defensible. If broadly based discounts are to be given, it would be\\nbetter to relate them to other household characteristics, such as whether or\\nnot it contains pensioners or dependent children.\\nNevertheless, this is not a bad tax, as domestic property taxes go.

Whether they can do so will become somewhat\\nclearer after next week's local elections. The government is certainly in\\nbetter shape on the issue than it was.

This\\ntime, it is contesting only 15 in Dr Owen's Devonport constituency  - three\\nof which are even being challenged by their old Alliance partners, the\\nLiberal Democrats.\\nMr Harold Luscombe, local SDP leader, admired by many but loathed by Labour,\\nclaims the party can hold the five seats it commands on the 60-seat council.\\nYet the impact of several defections to the Tories and a resurgent Labour\\nparty, especially in the job-depleted docklands, make that improbable.\\nPressed, Mr Luscombe admits that annihilation is a possibility.\\nUntil May 2 at least, the party will continue to fight on a fiercely\\nindependent platform that has something to irritate everyone in the big\\nparties.\\nThat includes a Torier-than-Tory plan to sell off a participation in the\\nstill uncompleted Pounds 25m municipal conference and leisure centre to the\\nprivate sector - opposed as unrealistic by the Conservatives.\\nMr Luscombe annoys Labour by castigating his old party as spendthrift. 'I\\nlook back on the last few years with a certain pride,' he says. 'Nationally,\\nwe have been the saviours of the Labour party.\\n'The ridiculous thing is that as the party leadership has become more\\nmoderate, the local party has been going the other way.'\\nThree miles away in Keyham ward, the sober suits and yet more sober language\\nof Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's national organiser, and Mr John Ingham, the\\nlocal leader, appear to tell a different story.\\nAs in the party's campaigns in Nottingham and Milton Keynes, the heavy\\nemphasis is on a council partnership with private enterprise and the\\ncommunity.\\nIf Tory taunts about a hidden agenda ring hollow, local Labour economics\\nseem firmly rooted in the wishful-thinking school. In Plymouth, the party\\nclaims it could have set a poll tax Pounds 10 below the Tories' Pounds 380\\nlargely by persuading non-payers to do their civic duty.\\nNevertheless, Labour - currently with 23 seats on the council to the Tories'\\n31 - looks in with a real chance to take control for the first time in 25\\nyears.\\nDr Colin Rallings, a psephologist at Plymouth's South West Polytechnic,\\ncalculates that the same 8 per cent swing is needed as Labour requires\\nnationally to take power.\\nLast year's county council elections in key Tory wards proved that was\\npossible. But in a general election, much would depend on whether Dr Owen's\\nfans jump left or right.\\nThe three-way split in all three parliamentary seats makes Devonport\\nwinnable for Labour. Dame Janet Fookes' Plymouth Drake is also vulnerable if\\nthe SDP vote collapses as predicted.\\nIronically, Mr Alan Clark, the defence minister much disparaged in Plymouth\\nfor failing to defend the city's navy interests, seems safest, with a 4,000\\nmajority over the Liberal Democrats.\\nPlymouth's difficulties - housing, the need to diversify from a single\\nindustry base, lack of development land - are relatively commonplace.\\nAs in the other towns visited by this diary, that creates difficulties from\\na political point of view, as the options are limited.\\nOften, for little more than the satisfaction of personal ambitions,\\nstrenuous efforts are made to dress up what a broad consensus into the\\ntribal warpaints of national politics.\\nOne missed opportunity is a curious fact that elsewhere might provoke\\ncontroversy - as a security measure the entire city centre is permanently\\nfilmed by video cameras, monitored by the council's security men.\\nIn the event, that draconian measure has not only sharply reduced petty\\ncrime - it has also met approval from Tory, Labour and Democrats of both\\nSocial and Liberal tendencies.\\nThree centuries on, the city that saw off the Armada has silently fallen to\\nthe unblinking tyranny of electronic technology.\",\n",

The initial reaction to its\\nsuccessor the council tax, finally announced yesterday after weeks of\\nagonising, was a qualified welcome to a pragmatic package targeted to meet\\nthe many anxieties of Conservative supporters.\\nHowever, the drastic nature of the solution, which represents the biggest\\npolitical U-turn for years, shows how traumatised ministers have become over\\nthe damage inflicted by the poll tax.\\nA return to the rates is a gamble which has no guarantee of success, but at\\nleast it gives ministers a chance to restore electoral credibility and to\\nseek to repair some of the harm done to the Tory party by the introduction\\nof a local tax widely perceived as regressive and unfair.\\nMr Heseltine's original idea was to launch an across-the-board inquiry into\\nall aspects of local government - finance, structure and organisation. That\\nremains the intention, but the indications from yesterday's consultation\\npapers are that the inquiry has degenerated into a piecemeal approach\\nbecause of the need to ditch the poll tax fast.\\nVirtually all effort has been focused on that. Any changes in structure and\\norganisation lie well in the future.\\nIn the short term, at least, the tactic might work. The figures show an\\nestimated average household charge for two or more people in the top\\nproperty band of Pounds 668 and in the lowest band of Pounds 267 - well\\nbelow the last average rates bill or the average poll tax paid last year.\\nThat is clearly good news for the government, particularly as the measures\\nhave been framed to avoid the big variations under the old rating system and\\nto ensure there are not too many losers in the prime Tory territory of the\\nsouth-east.\\nThere is therefore political logic in not creating too many losers among\\nTory supporters, and economic logic in the restoration of a link between the\\nsize of bills and ability to pay. It looks a skilful package, although it\\nwill lay the government open to the charge of looking after its own\\nsupporters at the cost of others.\\nYet many difficulties remain, mainly because no real attempt has been made\\nto link reform of finance to reform of structure. Mr Heseltine and Mr Major\\nmay ultimately pay a heavy price for such a lopsided approach. The\\nimpression remains that the shape of local government is being refashioned\\nalmost accidentally as a result of the earlier botched attempt to abolish\\nthe unpopular rating system.\\nThe establishment of a fairer, more soundly based method of local\\nrevenue-raising will not end the tensions between local and central\\ngovernment, stretched almost to breaking point by the bruising fiasco of the\\npoll tax.\\nThe confusion of responsibility between town halls and Whitehall has become\\nan increasing source of conflict over the last decade and the consultation\\npaper on structure showed that everything remains to be decided.\\nBattle lines are already being drawn up in the conflict that is about to\\nstart over the introduction of unitary authorities, with many counties\\nfighting for their existence against pressures from the districts to take\\nover their powers.\\nMr Heseltine has guaranteed a lengthy, messy process by emphasising that it\\nwill be largely up to local opinion to decide what form of local\\nadministration is required, including in some cases the retention of two\\ntiers of authorities.\\nPolitically the difficulty is that the majority of both county and district\\ncouncils are at present Conservative-led and the party could be badly split\\nby the conflicts.\\nThe blight of the poll tax might not yet be over.

Plans have also been published for streamlining local government\\nby introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and\\ndistrict councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications\\nTHE consultation document A New Tax For Local Government sets out in some\\ndetail the government's proposals for the new council tax, to come into\\neffect by April 1993.\\nBasic proposals: 'The government has decided that from the earliest possible\\nmoment the community charge will be replaced by a new system of local\\ntaxation. The new 'council tax' will comprise a property and a personal\\nelement. But it will take the form of a single bill for each household,\\nbased on the value of the property and the number of adults who live in it.'\\nDiscounts: As 54 per cent of households have two adults living in them, 'the\\ngovernment favours a discount approach on the assumption that there are two\\nadults in each household. Households with two or more adults would pay the\\nbasic council tax for their property. Single-adult households would pay less\\nthrough a personal discount indicated on the bill.\\n'Under these proposals, some 38m adults in Great Britain would be taken into\\naccount directly in calculating bills. Only 4m adults would be excluded,\\nmany of whom - for example students and people on income support - would be\\neligible for personal discounts even if they were to be counted for the tax.\\n'A significant advantage of the discount approach is that there is no need\\nfor a register of council tax payers. Households simply receive a bill which\\nassumes two adults, but pay a reduced bill through a discount where there is\\nonly one liable adult or two discounts where there are none or where the\\nproperty is not a principal place of residence.\\n'The government favours setting the personal discount as a percentage of the\\nbasic bill of the household. It proposes that the discount should be 25 per\\ncent of the basic bill.'\\nBanding: Assessing the taxable value of domestic properties based on rental\\nvalues, capital values or rebuilding costs . . . would pose various\\nproblems. The government therefore proposes to adopt a new approach: a\\nbanding system.\\n'Each property would be allocated to one of a small number of bands.\\nHouseholds in properties in the same band in a council's area would receive\\nthe same basic council tax bill. There would be no need for a detailed\\nvaluation of all dwellings.\\n'The banding system could be designed to ensure that excessive burdens did\\nnot fall on a minority of properties. Undue variations in bills arising from\\nregional variations in property values could be avoided. Banding would\\nreduce the administrative task involved in the introduction of the new\\ncouncil tax and allow it to be achieved more quickly.\\n'The government proposes a system by which all properties in an area would\\nbe placed in one of a small number of bands constructed around the average\\nproperty value in the relevant country - England, Scotland or Wales.\\n'The government proposes that a couple living in the highest band would pay\\ntwo thirds more than a couple living in a property in the middle band. A\\ncouple living in a property in the lowest band would pay two thirds of the\\nbill for a middle-band property. Overall, bills for couples in the highest\\nband would be two and a half times as much as those for couples in the\\nlowest band.'\\nValuation: The Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue will supervise the\\nassignment of properties to bands. There would be no need for regular or\\nfrequent revaluations of properties under a system of banding.\\nMultiple occupancy: The government proposes to bring some houses within the\\nscope of non-domestic rating when there is multiple occupancy, or where\\nadults are joint owners or tenants, recognising that many properties of this\\nkind are run as businesses.\\nSecond homes: Where a property is not anyone's main residence, the\\ngovernment proposes that the bill should then be reduced by the maximum of\\ntwo personal discounts.\\nRebates: 'The government proposes that, for individuals or couples on income\\nsupport or equivalent levels of income, rebates should meet 100 per cent of\\ntheir liability to the council tax. There would be no minimum contribution.\\n'People on incomes above the income support level will contribute on a\\nsliding scale.'\\nWhere non-dependants on low incomes live as the second adult in households\\nwhere the occupier is not eligible for a rebate, there should be a full\\npersonal discount where the person is at or below the income support level.\\nStudents: Where the first or second adult in a property is a student, a\\nstudent nurse, an apprentice or a Youth Training trainee, each will receive\\na full personal discount. If there are no other adults in a household of\\nstudents, the household will receive two discounts.\\nGovernment grants and assessments: The system of standard spending\\nassessments by central government will remain, and under the new council tax\\n'grants will be paid to local authorities so that each area can finance\\nspending at a standard level by levying the standard taxable amounts fixed\\nby the secretary of state for the council tax.\\n'Local authorities would retain discretion to set their budgets above or\\nbelow the standard level . . . The government's intention is that an\\nauthority's spending above or below the standard level will be reflected in\\nits council tax bills.\\n'The variation in spending should fall proportionately on the bills of all\\ncouncil tax payers in the area, so that each household would see an equal\\npercentage increase or reduction in their bill compared with the level for\\nstandard spending.'\\nTwo-tier authorities: 'In areas with more than one tier of authorities, the\\ntiers should each set their own separate element of the council tax, and the\\nseparate elements should be clearly identifiable on the single bill.'\\nCapping: The government will continue to use its powers to cap excessive\\nlocal authority spending. Powers for capping Scottish authorities will be\\nadjusted to equate with those in England and Wales.\\nBusiness rates: No changes are proposed in the business rate system\\nintroduced in 1990.\\nRoom N7/20 Department of the Environment, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P\\n3EB.

This would also apply to any expansion into\\nthese areas.\\nIn spite of reservations on a number of points, Mr Greenspan endorsed the\\ngeneral thrust of the Treasury's wide-ranging bank reform plan, saying it\\nattacked 'the major root causes of the problems in the banking system'. In\\nparticular, he said a majority of the Fed board supported the proposed\\noverhaul of deposit insurance, tightening of supervisory procedures, removal\\nof restrictions on interstate branch banking and authorisation of new\\ninvestment activities for well capitalised bank holding companies.\\nHowever, the prospects for comprehensive banking reform this year have\\nreceded because of a desire, especially on the House banking committee, to\\nconcentrate on legislation to bolster the financially strained bank\\ninsurance fund.\\nBut Mr Greenspan urged Congress to 'avoid only partial solutions by\\nseparating into component parts the comprehensive proposals for reform such\\nas those suggested by the Treasury.'\\nHe said the Fed board was troubled about the proposal that the Federal\\nDeposit Insurance Corporation could borrow up to Dollars 25bn (Pounds\\n14.7bn) from Federal Reserve Banks to absorb losses sustained by the bank\\ninsurance fund in dealing with failed banks.\\nThis would involve the Fed in directly funding the government. Such funding\\nalways been severely limited because of concerns about compromising the\\nindependent conduct of monetary policy. It would be better, and have an\\nidentical financial and economic impact, if the Treasury made the necessary\\nloans, he said.\\nMr Greenspan also warned against too large an increase in premiums paid by\\nbanks to support the insurance fund, which might threaten the soundness and\\ncompetitiveness of the banking system.\\nHe also underlined the Fed's opposition to removing its present supervisory\\nauthority over bank holding companies and limiting it to (mainly smaller)\\nstate chartered banks.\",\n",

The fiscal crunch in the US's biggest city is\\nbeing compounded by a mayor seemingly unable to take tough decisions, a\\nwhite business community nervous about upsetting the black mayor, and\\nbureaucrats and trade union leaders who want everyone to make sacrifices\\nexcept themselves.\\nNew York's latest budget worries have not yet reached the proportions of the\\nmid-1970s, when the city came close to financial collapse. 'It's a difficult\\nproblem, but it's not a crisis,' says Mr Quentin Spector, executive director\\nof the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the body set up 15 years ago as\\nbanker to the city, which now acts mainly as a financial adviser.\\nThe budget impasse has so far had little more impact on New Yorkers than the\\nprospect of a shortened season at municipal swimming pools this summer,\\nfewer lifeguards on the beaches, and a drive for private donations to save\\nthe Central Park petting zoo.\\nThe long-term damage could be far more severe. While the budget deficit is\\nprojected at a relatively manageable Dollars 450m-500m for the fiscal year\\nto June 30, it is expected to soar to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in 1991/92.\\nThe city's borrowing ability is also at risk, at a time when it needs to\\nraise about Dollars 3bn a year to fund new capital projects. New York bonds\\nare already trading at a premium of about 1 percentage-point to those of\\nissuers with a similar credit rating.\\nMr Don Mele, director for public issues at City Partnership, a non-profit\\ncivic group, is worried that the improvements made to New York's\\ninfrastructure over the past decade - ranging from street repairs to\\ngleaming new subway carriages - will gradually unravel if a solution is not\\nfound to the budget problem.\\nAt the core of the problem is New York's heavy exposure to the real estate\\nand financial services businesses, and related sectors, which have been\\nespecially hard hit by the recession. The city's economy tumbled into\\nrecession more than a year before the rest of the country, and has felt its\\nimpact far more severely.\\nAccording to the New York Port Authority, construction activity fell by 28\\nper cent last year, compared to a national decline of only 11 per cent. With\\nmany high-income earners in the financial services and related industries\\nout of work, retail sales dipped by 1.2 per cent last year, against a 3.9\\nper cent advance in the country as a whole.\\nMatters have been made worse by the dithering of Mayor David Dinkins and the\\nintransigence of the city's trade unions.\\nInstead of taking the tough decisions needed to balance the budget, Mr\\nDinkins has gone out of his way to avoid confrontation with the city's many\\nspecial interest groups. He lifted, then reimposed, a freeze on hiring\\nmunicipal workers. At the same time, he has proposed hiring several thousand\\npolice officers to dampen fears about a new crime wave.\\nSeveral deadlines are looming. The financial markets' opinion of New York's\\nfinancial condition will become clearer within the next 10 days when the\\ncity is expected to raise about Dollars 1bn in 'revenue-anticipation' bonds\\n -money required because the New York state budget, which will provide for\\ntransfers to the city, is itself almost a month overdue.\\nIf Mr Dinkins fails to bring the municipal budget shortfall below Dollars\\n100m by the end of June or if the city is shut out of the capital markets,\\nadministration of municipal finances could pass to the Financial Control\\nBoard, another agency set up in the mid-1970s to bring more discipline to\\nNew York's financial affairs.\\nThe chances are slim that the FCB, whose members include the governor, the\\nmayor, city and state comptrollers and three private-sector nominees, will\\nactually step in. Whether by fiscal prudence or by some sleight-of-hand\\naccounting, Mr Dinkins is likely to pull out all the stops to avoid the\\nhumiliation of outside intervention.\\nAccording to Mr Spector, 'the betting seems to be that the city will make it\\nthrough 1991 intact, but partly by mortgaging 1992. The question is: Will\\nthey use that time well?'\\nThe answer depends largely on how quickly the city emerges from recession\\nand can rebuild its eroded tax base. Ms Nancy Feldman, an analyst at\\nStandard & Poor's rating agency, asserts that 'there's no question New York\\nwill lag the rest of the country.'\\nThe danger is that a prolonged slump or very slow recovery will not give Mr\\nDinkins the tax revenues he needs to balance the 1991/92 budget. The city\\nwill then face far more unpleasant choices than it does today, plus the risk\\nof more severe labour strife and political turmoil.\",\n",

The claims\\nwere fiercely rejected by Labour, which said the new system would be\\nimpractical and unfair.\\nLocal authority associations were split, with praise from the\\nConservative-controlled Association of District Councils balanced by sharp\\ncriticism from the Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities.\\nMr Bryan Gould, Labour's shadow environment spokesman, said that the\\ngovernment's proposals meant that the poll tax would remain at least until\\n1993.

The key elements of the tax would apply also to Scotland\\nand Wales, although there might be technical differences.\\nThe illustrative figures produced by Mr Heseltine - hotly contested by Mr\\nGould - indicated that the new tax would bring an average bill for the\\ncheapest property with two adults of Pounds 200 this year against Pounds 668\\nfor one in the highest band.\\nThe environment secretary confirmed that single-person households would\\nreceive a 25 per cent discount, an element designed to reduce the burden on\\nelderly people living alone.\\nThe decision to base the tax on the assumption of two-person properties was\\nattacked by Labour, however, as a political fudge designed to placate\\nsupporters of the poll tax within the government's own ranks.\\nMinisters conceded that the new system would redistribute the burden of\\nlocal taxation from the north of England to more affluent areas in the\\nsouth.

The political calculation is that\\nalthough Tory voters in the south will be the main losers, the ceiling on\\nthe amount that councils will be allowed to levy from each of the seven\\nbands will cushion the impact.\\nMr Heseltine - who also published details of his plan to set up a local\\ngovernment commission to lead a move towards the creation of single-tier\\nauthorities - added that the government would retain its powers to cap\\nhigh-spending authorities.\\nWhile the key points of the new local tax are not negotiable in a\\nconsultation period which is due to last until June, the government is far\\nmore open to suggestions on the future structure of local government.\\nMr Patten will signal his determination to regain the political initiative\\nin the run-up to the general election at a press conference early this\\nmorning.\\nMinisters believe that the proposals may have come too late to have a\\ndecisive impact on next month's local elections, and most have all but ruled\\nout a June general election.\\nMost appear convinced, however, that with the poll tax behind them and\\nfurther falls in inflation and mortgage rates expected over the next few\\nmonths, Mr John Major should be in a position to call an election in the\\nautumn.\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCOUNCIL TAX - MAIN POINTS\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA council tax will replace the poll tax in April 1993.\\nIt will reflect the capital value of a property occupied by two adults\\nand give a 25 per cent discount to single people.\\nProperty will be valued in seven bands based on value.\\nPayment in the top band will be limited to 2.5 times that of the bottom\\nband.\\nThere will be a single bill for each household.\\nPoor people will be protected by discounts.\\nThere will be no minimum contribution.\\nSecond homes will receive a discount of 50 per cent.\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGamble to end Tory trauma, Page 8\\nEditorial comment, Page 18\",\n",

In east\\nGermany, the dismantling of the old communist system is causing immense\\nindustrial and social strains. And recession abroad, coupled in the case of\\nthe US with a rising dollar, has bit deeply into export earnings.\\nOn top of all this, the political climate has turned sour with the defeat of\\nChancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party (CDU) in his home state\\nof Rhineland-Palatinate.\\nAs well as demonstrating that voters had lost confidence in the government's\\nhandling of affairs after unity - they certainly disliked tax increases\\nafter promises that these could be avoided - the state election also removed\\nits majority in the upper house of Parliament (Bundesrat).\\nThus the Bonn cabinet could find life tougher in the months ahead, since the\\nBundesrat has the power of veto over legislation, including tax.\\nYet the stock market outlook is by no means all gloomy. Some analysts feel\\nthe time may be ripe for foreign institutional investors to pay more\\nattention to the German market, since it has so clearly failed to keep pace\\nwith other exchanges.\\n'People are underweight in a market which has underperformed,' says Ms\\nKatrin Kandell, an analyst at the London office of Sal. Oppenheim, the\\nGerman bank. 'They are starting to look at 1992. There has to be some\\npositive news in the next six months.'\\nWhat could that be? Indications of a bottoming out in the east German\\neconomic slump could be one element. Another could be evidence that the\\nknocks which west German exporters have taken over the past year are\\nbecoming less painful.\\nDegab, the investment analysis offshoot of Deutsche Bank, recently forecast\\nthat German corporate earnings would rise by around 8 per cent next year\\nafter declines of 5 per cent in 1990 and 1 per cent in 1991; in 1989, they\\ngrew by 13 per cent.\\nTwo sectors which have been especially buffeted by the problems on export\\nmarkets, chemicals and cars, are expected to show a marked improvement next\\nyear, while the surge in retail and consumer companies' profits should ease\\nand construction, helped by the rebuilding of east Germany, should remain\\nstrong.\\nGermany's construction companies are currently enjoying a prolonged boom,\\nwith business in the west also vigorous. A study by the Frankfurt office of\\nBarclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK stockbrokers, shows that seven out of the\\nGerman companies with the best liquidity ratios are from this sector. They\\nalso have valuable land and property assets, which are considerably\\nunderstated in their balance sheets.\\nBZW's German Company Handbook gives a good illustration of the financial\\nsolidity of German corporations. Out of 138 companies covered, 53 have no\\ngearing at all and only 21 have any net debt.\\nMoreover, 58 of them finance all capital spending through cash flow. Thus\\nthose with heavy future commitments in east Germany, such as RWE and Veba,\\nthe energy concerns, have plenty of scope for internal funding.\\nMr Harry Christopoulos, a BZW analyst, says: 'German companies have lots of\\nassets and low gearing.' Also, adds Ms Kandell, more of them are using their\\nproperty port-folios for development projects, thus unlocking some of their\\nvalue.\\nHer hope is that German companies, prompted by the demands of east German\\ninvestment or the desire to ward off unfriendly takeovers, will start to pay\\nmore attention to their share prices. At present, they can lower their tax\\nbills by salting away profits in reserves and thus understating earnings.\\nOne day, though, EC tax harmonisation may change all that.\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                          ASSET ANALYSIS\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   Company          *Land and       Company                *Liquidity\\n                    buildings\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1  Leffers               52.2       Hochtief                    42.1\\n2  Horten                43.1       Dyckerhoff & Widmann        39.3\\n3  Hornbach              40.9       Kampa-Haus                  38.0\\n4  WERU                  40.1       Bilfinger+Berger            37.9\\n5  Harpener              39.8       Kali und Salz               35.0\\n6  Kaufhalle             38.2       Linotype                    32.4\\n7  Kampa-Haus            31.1       Hako                        30.6\\n8  Kaufhof               29.4       SABO                        28.4\\n9  Karstadt              29.1       Strabag                     28.2\\n10 ASKO                  28.2       Holzmann                    27.7\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n*As % of Balance Sheet total at end 1989\\nSource: Barclays de Zoete Wedd\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\",\n",

This included stock exchanges themselves as well as brokers, he said.\\nPartly as a result of the shifting boundaries in the securities business,\\nlarge institutions have already moved to integrate a range of intermediary\\nfunctions, from acting as investment managers to being brokers and\\nprincipals in securities trades.\\nThis vertical integration would allow them to move resources most\\neffectively between the different functions to meet opportunities, he said.\\nMr Gerhard Eberstadt, member of the board of managing directors of Dresdner\\nBank, listed this vertical integration as one of the indispensable\\ncomponents of any financial intermediary's strategy in the coming years.\\nOthers, he said, were a clear, earnings-related focus on the segments and\\ngeographical areas in which an intermediary plans to operate; a focus on\\nearnings rather than turnover; and a modern, customer- oriented distribution\\nsystem.\\nMr Eberstadt added that universal banks, similar to those in Germany, were\\nbest placed to take advantage of deregulation in Europe.\\nUniversal banks do not suffer the same pressures as investment or commercial\\nbanks to constantly try to overcome regulatory hurdles by developing new\\nfinancial products, he said.\\n'These (products) do not necessarily suggest a greater emphasis of a more\\nrigorous approach to risk management, as is often stated.\\n'They tie up important resources to circumvent artificially created hurdles,\\nwhich are then not available for other, more productive purposes of\\nfinancial intermediation.'\\nUniversal banks do not suffer these pressures, since they can switch\\nresources between commercial and investment banking, he said. 'It is not\\ndifficult to forecast a global trend toward universal banking for the coming\\nyears,' he added.\\nResponding to a question later, Mr Post said he did not believe investment\\nbusiness in Europe would concentrate into the hands of a few, large\\nuniversal banks.\\nAs had already happened in the US, investors in Europe would come to\\nunderstand the benefits of selecting intermediaries on the basis of\\nperformance, and this would lead to more varied choice.\\nMr Howard Coates, deputy chairman of BZW equities, said that the challenges\\nfacing intermediaries in Europe were greater than those they faced elsewhere\\nin the world.\\nThis is because, in addition to the challenges posed by deregulation,\\nintermediaries had to cope with the problems of dealing in many, often small\\nlocal markets, with the same securities often being traded on more than one\\nmarket. In addition, cultural and historic differences meant that different\\ntypes of investor and issuer demanded a different approach from\\nintermediaries.\\nBZW's response to the higher costs and lower income in securities markets\\nhad been in part to focus on higher value products, and in part to pare each\\nbusiness so that it could survive even in difficult periods.\\nDifferent equities, such as French equities, are treated as different\\nproducts and given their own profit and loss account, he said. In addition,\\nBZW now reviews its customers by the profits that the firm generates from\\nbusiness it does with them.\",\n",

The proposals have been\\nprompted by government plans to radically re-design and streamline the\\nelectricity sector.\\nMadrid wants to take the country's 12 generators - most of which also\\ncontrol their own distribution networks - and create just two or three\\ngroups. Ideally, it would then hand over nationwide distribution to a single\\ncompany which would be able to buy electricity from, and sell it to, Spain's\\nneighbours in the European single market after 1992.\\nThe big private utilities - Hidrola, Iberduero, Sevillana and Union Fenosa -\\nhave become alarmed at the prospect of being pressed by the government into\\narrangements and mergers that do not suit them. They have been desperately\\ntrying to come up with their own plans to pre-empt the government's plans.\\nThe commotion sweeping the sector - the second biggest on the Madrid Stock\\nExchange after the banking industry - has been compounded recently by\\naggressive corporate raiding by the state-controlled generator, Endesa, the\\ncountry's biggest generator, from which the private utilities are obliged to\\nbuy what they claim is overpriced power.\\nEndesa's acquisitions include 10 per cent of Sevillana, the big Andalucian\\nutility in 1989, and, this year, 80 per cent of Electra de Viesgo in the\\nnorth, and smaller stakes in Fecsa, the Catalan utility, and Union Fenosa,\\nwhich also operates in northern Spain.\\n'This is little more than nationalisation,' said a senior Spanish banker\\ninvolved in the industry. Spanish banks own stakes in most utilities and\\nvote up to 40 per cent of utility shares using proxy votes at shareholder\\nmeetings. Analysts believe Endesa may be accumulating the stakes to get into\\ndistribution or to use in an eventual swap of assets which the government\\nmight order to facilitate its reorganisation.\\nAt the heart of the debate is a highly complex system of compensations\\nerected by the government in 1987 to keep tariffs standard nationwide. This\\nassists high-cost producers by forcing efficient generators to distribute a\\nshare of their income around less fortunate operators.\\nEndesa, probably reflecting government plans, says it wants three groups\\ncreated, with Hidrola and Iberduero and itself leading them. This would\\nleave Endesa free to take control of Sevillana, Fecsa and Union Fenosa.\\nA combined Hidrola and Iberduero, which would bring together Iberduero's\\nstrong hydro-electrical assets and more modern conventional generating plant\\nat Hidrola, would pose a strong industrial threat to Endesa's vision.\\nCombined generating capacity would be close to that of the newly-created\\nPowerGen in the UK. Total shareholder equity in Hidrola and Iberduero would\\nbe more than Pta1,000bn (Dollars 9.2bn), compared with the Endesa group's\\ncurrent Pta472bn. Combined long-term debt, though, would total Pta1,300bn,\\nagainst Endesa's current Pta450bn.\\nThe Energy Ministry, which is designing a new national energy tariff plan to\\ncoincide with the reorganisation of the sector in the next few months, could\\nblock a merger simply by threatening it with unprofitable compensation\\narrangements even though it seems unlikely to drop its unified tariff.\\nMadrid, however, is loathe to be seen to be over manipulative of private\\nsector companies and may give it the green light if, in return, shareholders\\nin Sevillana, Fecsa and Union Fenosa can be persuaded to ease Endesa's entry\\nas the other main controlling force in the sector.\",\n",

I sat on the bed and I had this terrific pain, and\\nout pops this baby, and I thought 'Where's that come from?' It was fixed to\\nme by the cord and I thought 'I haven't got to go through life with that\\nfixed to me, surely?' I didn't even know I was pregnant. I was petrified.\\nThe mistress comes in and she says 'You wicked girl, Betty, look at the mess\\nyou've made. You've got to pay for those sheets, you're not getting any\\nwages'. Next thing I knew the ambulance men came and took me off to a mother\\nand baby's home'.\\nThe astonishing thing about this is that Betty Jones is not an actress\\ndelivering lines from an 18th century diary but a woman speaking to us from\\nher own memory. We see her in Episode 3 of the BBC2 series A Secret World Of\\nSex which began last night and will continue for another five weeks. Once in\\na while a series turns up, usually documentary, which really does what the\\ncliche says: opens a window on the world to reveal something which we may\\nhave heard about, but had never seen clearly before.\\nBetty Jones's recollection typifies the way in which A Secret World Of Sex\\nachieves this. With a vividness and immediacy which is often enthralling,\\nand all too frequently painful, it uses personal witness to lay before us\\nthe ignorance, guilt, fear and cruelty which surrounded virtually every\\naspect of sex for those who grew up in the first quarter of the 20th\\ncentury. Again and again women who had never been told how pregnancy\\noccurred ('I thought what he was doing was just the 'in' thing') explain how\\nthey attempted suicide rather than face the stigma of an illegitimate child.\\nA woman who was raped when she was 14 tells matter of factly how she could\\nnot possibly explain this to her mother. She had a breakdown and ended up in\\nmental hospital.\\nThe series was commissioned by BBC Bristol from the independent company\\nDomino Films, but the moving spirit behind it is Steve Humphries. Eight\\nyears ago, as a lecturer in social history at Essex University, he began the\\nresearch work for a book. He says: 'I was curious to find out how the old,\\nnarrow attitudes towards sex affected the lives of people brought up before\\nthe last world war. The taboo on sex amongst that generation is still so\\ngreat that we know very little about their sexual experience. I decided that\\nthe only way to find out what happened was to ask them before it was too\\nlate.'\\nSo he did, and the interviews form a major part of his book, also called A\\nSecret World Of Sex, which appeared in 1988 (Sidgwick & Jackson, Pounds\\n11.99). It contains many of the stories, photographs, and statistics which,\\nas director/producer, he has now included in the BBC series. But what the\\nbook does not and cannot include is the tone of voice, the glint in the eye,\\nthe defiance of those who agreed to tell their stories for his cameras.\\nNo doubt the very fact that they did agree proves that they are atypical:\\nmore self confident than most, a bit bolshie perhaps, in many cases\\nremarkably brave, even by the standards of this new age of supposed\\npermissiveness. It must take considerable courage for a white haired lady in\\nher seventies to describe in front of a film crew how her parents came home\\nunexpectedly when she was with her boyfriend and 'I had to push my knickers\\nin my handbag'. There is of course humour. Last night's opening programme\\nincluded an account from Evelyn Nelson (81) of necking in a field of long\\ngrass when the farmer called a policeman who blew his whistle and demanded\\nthey come out: 'It was like a football match, so many people got up'.\\nHowever, some of these first person accounts are so appalling that it is\\ndifficult to go on watching. Yesterday's programme included the story of\\nEdna Higginbottom, born in 1923, who was discovered by her grandfather to be\\nhaving a sexual relationship when she was 15. He called the police who asked\\n'Did intercourse take place?' and upon being told 'Yes' hauled her into\\ncourt where her grandfather said 'Shut her away' and signed the necessary\\npapers. She was promptly locked up in a mental home and kept there for 20\\nyears. Nor was this particularly unusual, it seems: under the 1913 Mental\\nDefectives Act, girls who brought shame on the family by consorting with men\\nwere routinely locked away.\\nThere is nothing revolutionary or, these days, even very unusual about the\\nway these programmes are made. My own shorthand for the technique is 'World\\nAt War' because they employ the mixture of archive film, still photographs,\\nand new interviews of those with good memories which was used so powerfully\\nin the memorable Thames series about World War II. A Secret World Of Sex\\ngains greatly from a model delivery of the commentary - in other words\\nunselfishly unnoticeable - by Zoe Wanamaker (who recently gave such an\\noutstanding performance as the murderer's moll in Prime Suspect) with none\\nof the distracting histrionics which Laurence Olivier loaded onto The World\\nAt War.\\nEach of the six episodes deals with a particular taboo: sex before marriage,\\npornography and prostitution, illegitimate babies, homosexuality, sexual\\nviolence, and VD. They are packed with memorable vignettes: the description\\nof men at Soho's old Windmill theatre with cameras hidden in chocolate\\nboxes; Lady Marguerite Tangye's account of debs' delights being aroused by\\ndebs in the backs of cars and then resorting to the lower class gels at the\\nBag O'Nails club for relief.\\nSome programmes are better than others, the most powerful of the lot being\\nthe third, 'In Disgrace', which tells of five women, including Betty Jones,\\nwho bore illegitimate babies: 'I felt like killing myself, but didn't know\\nhow to start' . . . 'I was treated like an outcast' . . . 'My mother saw my\\nmorning sickness and said 'Are you pregnant?' and I said 'What's pregnant?''\\nThe wickedness of keeping young women in ignorance, and then persecuting\\nthem for the natural results of that ignorance is enough to make you scream\\nwith anger. However sad today's one-parent family phenomenon, it is surely\\nbetter than this hideous injustice.\\nBut the most impressive aspect of the series is its collective strength.\\nTogether these programmes manage to convey not just a graphic impression of\\nthe sexual aspects of pre-war society, but a powerful sensation of how it\\nmust have felt to live with all that guilty conscience, and terror, and\\nvictimisation. As you listen to the self-righteous sermonising of the\\nreligious and the 'purity league' members, it serves as a forceful reminder\\nof how many would still like to drag us back into that cesspit of ignorance\\ntoday. In the name of 'innocence' the moralists want to sterilise television\\nand push young people back into the dark. Yet it seems unlikely they will\\nmanage it.  The most heartening aspect of this series is the character of\\nthe people who agreed to talk to Steve Humphries. Of necessity they are in\\ntheir seventies, eighties or nineties, yet few of them look or sound\\nanything like that old. Perhaps an enthusiasm for sex keeps you young.\\nMoreover, even allowing for the fact that they are by definition the bolder\\nmembers of their generation, it is their obduracy which is so striking. As\\nEastern Europeans later in the century would survive the political\\ntotalitarianism of their societies, these Britons outlasted the moral\\ntotalitarianism of theirs, showing that the human spirit can withstand just\\nabout anything.\",\n",

It even\\ninfluenced those who stayed at home, such as Cuyp. The work of these Dutch\\nItalianates is perhaps the most neglected aspect of the Golden Age of Dutch\\npainting.\\nA small, predominantly loan exhibition at Richard L.

After Jan Both, and\\nalong with Nicholaes Berchem, he is arguably the most important of the\\nsecond and most interesting generation of Dutch Italianate landscape\\npainters. The show is the first devoted to him. It serves as a reappraisal\\nand as a reminder of the enthusiasm for 17th century Dutch painting in\\nmid-18th century Britain which was to have a profound influence on the\\ncourse of landscape painting in this country, from Richard Wilson to Turner.\\nPynacker's first biographer, Arnold Houbraken - his latest, Laurie Harwood,\\nhas curated this show - states that the artist spent three years in Italy.\\nIt seems likely that he was there 1645-48, and that he was travelling on his\\nfather's behalf as a wine merchant. The paintings executed on his return are\\nthe results of remembered experience.\\nThere are 11 paintings on show. With the Dulwich Picture Gallery's 'Bridge\\nin an Italian Landscape' of around 1653, we catch our first glimpse of\\nPynacker's mastery. The clarity of its unifying light is breathtaking. The\\nlow-lying sun illuminates the underside of the bridge, catches the water and\\nspangles the slender-leafed long grasses, the tree trunks and hanging vines\\nwith silver and gold. The muleteer and goatherd, who strike up conversation\\non the bridge surrounded by their stock, are naturalistically grouped; the\\nfigures and the dog are softly silhouetted against the bluish mountains\\nbeyond.\\nAlready various elements of the Pynacker repertory are established: the\\nserpentine contortions of the overlapping trees (derived from Both); gnarled\\nbirch stumps invaded by fungi; and silver-tinted long grasses. An open,\\nluminous sky around the light source fills one half of the canvas and acts\\nas a foil to the dark woody hills of the other.\\nPynacker is probably best known for the larger canvases he painted in\\nAmsterdam in the 1660s, examples of which can be seen in the Wallace\\nCollection (which cannot lend) and the Dulwich Picture Gallery. This small\\nbut delightful show, especially if augmented by visits to Hertford House and\\nDulwich, probably serves Pynacker better than an exhibition of 100\\npaintings.\\nAnother Dulwich picture takes a bow at the National Gallery, in the first of\\nits new series of Brief Encounters (until April 28). The aim of the series\\nis to explore the relationship between two paintings closely related in\\ntechnique, style and subjectmatter, one from the permanent collection and\\nthe other a loan. What better start than the Samson and Delilahs by Rubens\\nand his disciple Van Dyck, the latter seen for the first time in Britain\\nsince its cleaning for the recent exhibition in Washington.\\nMantegna's treatment of the subject is misogynous; Rembrandt's is brutal;\\nRubens, in contrast, allows Delilah a moment of reflection. The shorn hero\\nis still asleep in her arms, the soldiers at the door. She looks down at her\\ndoomed lover with an expression of triumph tinged with tenderness and a hint\\nof regret. The pose of the two figures echoes a pieta.\\nRubens painted this glowing, opulent and dramatic tour-de-force after his\\nreturn from Italy, in 1609. A decade later, the 20-year-old Van Dyck\\nborrowed the composition and reversed it. In every respect, his reworking of\\nthe subject makes for a disappointing contrast.

But you can minimise the risk through good design. There has been a\\nbig push towards quality in industrial processes. If you improve quality it\\nis a safer company, a cleaner company and it makes a profit.'\\nThe UK Government has been under attack for failing to provide enough staff\\nand resources for the inspectorate to carry out its enhanced role.\\nIntegrated pollution control means that the branches of the old\\ninspectorates covering pollution of air, water and land have been merged\\ninto one organisation embracing all these areas.

When jobs were advertised recently\\nmore than 600 applications poured in. 'These are very encouraging signs,' he\\nsays.\\nHe is confident that morale has improved at the inspectorate. 'It has to be\\nprofessional, credible, competent and independent and I am sure it is going\\nto be that way.\\n'There are a lot of very good inspectors out there at the sharp end. They\\nhave the industrial expertise and they know what the problems and\\npracticalities are.'\\nThe inspectorate is to be given agency status so that it can operate more\\nflexibly and at arm's length from government. Slater welcomes this: 'It\\nmakes a lot of sense, it is a natural evolution.'\\nHe is cautious, however, over suggestions that Britain might eventually need\\na powerful independent agency to act as a 'green' policeman along the lines\\nof the US Environmental Protection Agency.\\nIn recent years Slater has been in charge of Technica's US operation and his\\nexperience has made him sceptical of importing the US model. He found the\\nAmerican system to be adversarial and believes the mechanisms now being\\nintroduced by the Government may fit better into the British scene.\\nHe emphasises that the inspectorate is prepared to listen to the problems of\\nindustry but cannot take on the role of a commercial consultancy advising\\ncompanies. 'That is not good for industry,' he says. 'They have to develop\\ntheir own expertise.'\\nOn the one hand the new pollution control regime has been criticised by some\\nsections of industry for being too tough. On the other it has been attacked\\nby the environmental movement as too weak.\\nSlater is philosophical about this. 'If you do your job properly you may end\\nup being somewhat unpopular with both sides,' he says.

(They are still not fully\\nunder control).\\nWhile Japan has banned the worst form of percussive piling - the diesel\\nhammer - in Tokyo and several other cities, Hong Kong has chosen not to\\nbring in sweeping regulations which rule out the use of specific pieces of\\nmachinery.\\nUsually pragmatic in its dealings with industry over environmental matters,\\nthe Hong Kong Government devised legislation which contained incentives for\\ncontractors to switch from the noisiest type of percussive piling (the\\ndiesel hammer) to quieter methods of both percussive and non-percussive\\npiling.\\nQuieter percussive methods include the hydraulic hammer and the drop hammer,\\nwhile non-percussive methods include hand-dug caissons (wells dug by hand\\ninto which reinforced concrete is put) and mechanically bored piles (hollow\\ncolumns made by drills which grind and/or break the rock into which\\nreinforcement is put).\\nThe system, which was implemented in late 1989, offers percussive piling\\noperators three kinds of daily permits - a three-hour permit for piling\\noperations which are unacceptably noisy (those which exceed the accepted\\nnoise level for an area by more than 10 decibels); a five-hour permit for\\nthose which are moderately noisy (those which exceed the level by between\\none and 10 decibels); and a full 12-hour permit for piling operations which\\ndo not exceed the acceptable noise level.\\nAn added incentive is that quiet piling methods are permitted to run all\\nnight, while the hours of operation for the three- and five-hour permits are\\nnot chosen to the convenience of the contractor, but by the Environmental\\nProtection Department.\\nAs time costs money and as construction deadlines are tight in Hong Kong,\\nthe aim was to make noisy piling a frustrating, inefficient and uneconomic\\nproposition. The controls have brought about some improvements in the\\nthinking and behaviour of the construction industry in Hong Kong - it has\\nencouraged some of the larger contractors to test quieter methods of piling\\nand suppliers such as Daido of Japan and BSP of Britain to try to sell new\\nand more sophisticated piling technology to the local market.\\nAccording to one of the largest local suppliers of construction equipment,\\nChina Engineers, the controls have also caused the sales of new diesel\\nhammers to dry up in the last few years.\\nBut statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection Department present\\nsomething of a dilemma - the number of three-hour permits has not declined\\nduring 1990, meaning the incentive scheme is not working or at least not as\\nquickly as it was intended to.\\nOn Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, the two most built-up parts of Hong Kong\\nand hence the most 'noise sensitive', the combined number of three-hour\\npermits in each quarter last year was, respectively, 60, 70, 58, 60. In the\\nNew Territories, the rural/new urban development part of Hong Kong, the\\npermit numbers were 19, 23, 16, 12.\\nEven more discouraging is the fact that the total number of three-hour\\npermits (318) exceeded the total number of five-hour and 12-hour permits\\ncombined (276). But the Environmental Protection Department does not feel\\ndefeated by these statistics and believes contractors are going through a\\ntransition period. It will soon carry out a survey to ask contractors\\nwhether they are planning to use quieter methods.\\nAndrew Kwan Siu-hei, acting principal environmental protection officer in\\nthe Noise Control Group, said many of Hong Kong's contractors are small\\noperators who are reluctant to change their work practices and reluctant to\\nbuy new equipment. 'Maybe they (the small contractors) are used to the old\\ntechnology. Better to let large contractors test new methods. I think sooner\\nor later they will change,' said Kwan.\\nConstruction industry representatives say the issue is complicated and that\\nthe problem lies with Hong Kong's outdated building regulations. These\\nregulations are enforced by another government department, the Buildings and\\nLands Department, whose record of co-operation with the Environmental\\nProtection Department is less than good.\\nAlthough the regulations are about to be revised, so far they have\\nundermined the success of the incentive scheme. Rod Buckell, technical\\nmanager with the piling company Franki Kier and chairman of the\\nenvironmental committee of the Hong Kong Construction Association, said\\ncontractors would change overnight if the financial incentive was there.\\nThe reason they did not was because an outdated formula governing pile\\ndriving in the building regulations makes it cheaper to use diesel hammers\\nrather than hydraulic hammers, which would be given a five-hour permit under\\nthe Hong Kong system. Contractors cannot simply switch to bored piles for\\nevery job because they mostly follow tender designs drawn up by engineers\\nand because the type of piling used depends on a number of factors,\\nprimarily cost, time, the size and type of site, and the weight of the\\nbuilding being erected.\\n'Quietness has nothing to do with the design of piling in Hong Kong. Cost is\\nparamount,' said Buckell. There is one area, however, where the new piling\\ncontrols are having a definite beneficial effect - the ability to pile all\\nnight with quiet methods. Buckell said this has made bored piling using new\\nand sophisticated equipment more economic than it was before and has helped\\nto loosen the hold percussive or 'driven piling' has on the industry.\\n'By limiting the number of hours driven can work, bored is now economic,'\\nsaid Buckell. He estimates the permit system has increased the cost of\\ndriven piling (using steel piles) by about 10 to 15 per cent. But Buckell\\nalso asks, why use piles at all for the foundations of buildings?\\nThe cutting edge of foundation work these days in Hong Kong and countries\\nsuch as France, Germany and Canada is a method called 'deep compaction'. The\\nsoil is compacted almost back into its rocky state by vibration using steel\\npokers or is pressed down under the impact of a heavy mass. It is useful for\\nland reclamation work, of which Hong Kong will be doing a lot over the next\\n10 years, and at HKDollars 15 (Pounds 1) per cubic metre it costs about half\\nthe price of piling.\\nIts main drawbacks are that it can only be done on sand - not on mud - and\\nthe height of buildings above is limited to about 11 storeys. Yet it is not\\nhard to see that 'deep compaction' could have wide application throughout\\nAsia, especially in countries where earthquake problems limit the height of\\nbuildings, such as in Taiwan, or in developing countries which do not need\\nto build skyscrapers.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3643': \"AT LAST the Jobs column has been supplied with a clue to a question that has\\nmystified it these past 18 years or more. Why do senior executives, mostly\\naged at least 40, typically resist taking on people over 40 to work for them\\nas executives?\\nThe reason usually cited for refusing to recruit same is that folk of such\\nadvanced years are no longer up to the work. But that surely rebounds\\nawkwardly on the executives doing the recruiting. So unless there is\\nevidence that the 'past-it' clause does not apply to 40-pluses already\\nranked as seniors (and I've never seen any) we would seem to be faced with a\\nparadox.\\nFortunately, a way out has been found by recruiter Barrie Whitaker of the\\nconsultancy arm of Price Waterhouse. His work entails assessing\\njob-candidates by a variety of measures - tests of verbal and numerical\\nreasoning, and of personality, as well as 'in-tray' exercises  - and he has\\nlately compared the under-40s' results with those of their elders.\\nSo far, only one occupational group has provided him with enough candidates\\nfor the findings to be statistically respectable. It consists of finance\\nexecutives, of whom he has tested 100 on the right side of the age bar, and\\n77 on the wrong side. But he says the results are similar for other types\\nsuch as general managers and personnel and production people.\\nA further thing that proved much the same was the reasoning-test performance\\nof the under- and over-40s. Apart from a marginal lead for the younger set\\non the numerical measure, there was no difference between them.\\nWhere the two age-groups did contrast was in persuasiveness, friendliness,\\ndecisiveness and astuteness. The oldies came out stronger on all those\\ncounts, which would apparently give them an edge in the job of managing.\\nNevertheless there were other factors which cast light on their unpopularity\\nas executive recruits. For example, the oldies were more critical and\\ncontrolling than the younger set, and less democratic, practical and\\nconscientious in sticking to boring, repetitive tasks.\\nHence it seems that, at the same time as being better equipped to work as\\nmanagers, the over-40s are more difficult to manage. But that still leaves\\nthe question why senior executives of comparable years are averse to taking\\non the challenge of managing them.\\nThe answer, Barrie Whitaker thinks, lies in another unexpected difference he\\nhas found between the two age-groups. The over-40s are more competitive. So\\nsenior recruiters, being of that nature themselves, probably see similarly\\ninclined as well as better equipped older candidates as a greater threat to\\nthem in their own positions.\\nNOW to the table below, which gives indications of the pay prospects held\\nout by different kinds of specialist work in the United Kingdom.

But, in addition to the difference between\\nsums paid out and sums recovered, he can claim interest at a commercial rate\\non the loan sum, to compensate for the time he was deprived of its use.\\nThe House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the defendant valuer,\\nMr Alastair Gibson, a chartered surveyor, from a Court of Appeal decision\\n(FT, April 6 1990) upholding a County court assessment of Pounds 7,136\\ndamages owed by him to the plaintiff, Swingcastle Ltd.\\nLORD LOWRY said that at the beginning of 1985 Mr John Clarke and his wife\\nwere in financial difficulties. Their home was mortgaged. They owed Pounds\\n1,700 to a building society and Pounds 6,300 to a finance company.\\nBeing anxious to pay off those debts, they went to brokers whose business\\nincluded putting borrowers in touch with lenders.\\nThe brokers instructed the valuer to survey the property and give a report\\nfor the benefit of whoever might become their lending principals.\\nThe valuer placed the forced sale value at Pounds 18,000. Relying on his\\nvaluation, Swingcastle lent Mr and Mrs Clarke Pounds 10,000 secured by a\\nfirst charge over the property.\\nThe entire loan was used to pay the Pounds 1,700 and Pounds 6,300 debts, and\\nthe Pounds 2,000 brokers' fee.\\nThe loan was repayable by 120 monthly instalments at 36.51 per cent annual\\ninterest. If the borrowers went into arrears, the lenders were entitled to\\nadd outstanding interest to the principal sum and charge interest on the\\nwhole, at 45.619 per cent.\\nThe borrowers quickly fell into arrears and surrendered possession on June\\n30 1986. The lenders sold the property for Pounds 12,000. Completion took\\nplace on February 27 1987. On September 4 1987 the lenders issued a writ\\nagainst Mr Gibson, claiming damages for loss allegedly sustained by them in\\nreliance on his negligent valuation.\\nThey pleaded loss comprised of Pounds 19,912.96, being the 'amount required\\nto redeem the loan as at February 27 1987', Pounds 401.35 estate agents'\\nfees, and Pounds 983.25 legal costs. Those sums, less the Pounds 12,000 sale\\nproceeds totalled Pounds 9,297.56.\\nLiability was admitted in the County court and it was admitted that but for\\nthe valuer's negligence the lenders would not have made any loan to the\\nborrowers. The sole issue was the measure of damages on the basis that, on a\\ncompetent valuation the lenders would have made no loan.\\nAbout some of the figures there was no dispute. The lenders' outgoings\\nincluded the Pounds 10,000, the Pounds 401.35 and the Pounds 983.25. On the\\nother side of the account, the lenders had received Pounds 1,734 from the\\nborrowers between February 1985 and April 1986, and Pounds 12,000 from the\\npurchasers of the property.\\nThe disputed ingredient was the Pounds 19,912.96.\\nThe lenders arrived at that figure by calculating the amount of principal\\nand interest outstanding, having regard to the initial 36.51 per cent rate,\\nand the 45.619 per cent penal rate.\\nIn the County court Judge Harris QC allowed the claim and gave judgment for\\nPounds 7,136.41 with interest and costs.\\nThe valuer's case was that damages should have been assessed on the basis\\nthat the lenders were entitled to be placed in the position that they would\\nhave been in if they had received a competent valuer's report and had\\nconsequently made no loan.\\nHe said damages were to be calculated on the footing that the lenders should\\n(1) take credit for the Pounds 10,000, the Pounds 401.35, and the Pounds\\n983.25; and (2) give credit for Pounds 1,734 paid and Pounds 12,000 received\\non sale of the property; and that the lenders had for two years been\\ndeprived of the use of Pounds 10,000 which they would not have lent but for\\nthe negligent valuation.\\nIn the court of Appeal Lord Justice Neill reviewed a number of authorities\\nincluding Baxter v Gapp (1939) 2KB 271 which had been successfully relied on\\nin the County court. He concluded Baxter was binding and that the judge was\\nright to assess the damages in the way that he did.\\nHe then considered the case as if it were free from authority.\\nHe began with the principle in Livingstone v Rawyards (1880) 5 App Cas\\n25,39, that damages should 'put the party who has been injured . . . in the\\nsame position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong'.\\nHe said that where a client would not have lent at all but for the negligent\\nvaluation, a number of approaches to assessment were possible. One was that\\nthe lender could be awarded unpaid interest owed when the security was\\nrealised. That was the method adopted in Baxter.\\nBut, said Lord Justice Neill, 'to award damages on this basis is in effect\\nto treat the valuer as the guarantor of the contract of loan'. In the\\nabsence of authority he would have rejected that solution.\\nOther methods, he said, were to award a sum equivalent to what the money\\nwould have earned as interest on another loan, or on deposit or if invested\\nelsewhere. Whether any of those methods suited a case would depend on the\\nevidence.\\nBaxter was regarded by all three members of the Court of Appeal as authority\\nfor accepting the lenders' approach to the claim for interest.\\nIn Baxter, (1) the trial judge calculated interest by reference to what the\\nmortgagor had failed to pay under her contract; but (2) the appropriate rate\\nof interest was never an issue between the parties or in the mind of the\\ncourt. The real issue was whether the plaintiff could recover consequential\\nloss.\\nHaving regard to point (1), the case was almost by accident an authority for\\nthe proposition by which the Court of Appeal in the present case found\\nitself reluctantly bound.\\nBaxter was not an attractive precedent. The approach seemed contrary to\\nprinciple. The aggrieved party was entitled to be placed in the same\\nposition as if the wrong had not occurred, not to receive compensation for\\nlost interest at the contractual rate.\\nThe valuer's approach in the present case, and Lord Justice Neill's\\nanalysis, were correct.\\nWhat the lenders lost was the use of the Pounds 10,000 while locked up in\\nthe loan.\\nThere was no cut and dry solution to calculating the amount of damages in\\ncases of this kind. It depended on the evidence.\\nThe lenders ought to have presented their claim on the basis that, if the\\nvaluer had advised properly, they would not have lent the money. Where they\\nwent wrong was to claim that the valuer deprived them of interest they would\\nhave received if the borrowers had paid up. The fallacy of their case was\\nthat they had been trying to obtain compensation for the borrowers' failure,\\nnot damages for the valuer's negligence.\\nTaking Pounds 10,000, Pounds 401.35 and Pounds 983.25 on one side, and\\nPounds 12,000 and Pounds 1,734 on the other, the lenders were Pounds\\n2,349.40 in credit.\\nIn the absence of evidence as to how the lenders financed the loan or how\\nthe money, if not lent, could have been profitably employed, 12 per cent\\ninterest was the proper rate at which to recompense the lenders for being\\ndeprived of their Pounds 10,000. Two years would yield Pounds 2,400, but one\\nmight ask whether it was reasonable for the valuer to bear liability to date\\nof sale in February 1987, the property having been surrendered in June 1986.\\nIt was for the lenders to prove their case. They had not appeared. In the\\nlight of that fact and the figures, it would not be fair or sensible to\\nremit the action to the County court for new assessment.\\nThe appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed.\\nFor Mr Gibson: Roger Toulson QC and Roger Stewart (Reynolds Porter\\nChamberlain).\\nSwingcastle was not represented.\",\n",

'I turned up with my official briefcase and the gate-keeper\\nimmediately alerted the staff that Customs and Excise were on the premises.\\nThe company was not up to anything but it liked to be prepared when\\nofficialdom called. I was quickly given a less formal-looking briefcase.'\\nThough Whitehall-wise, Morgan was naive when it came to the business world\\nand jumped at the opportunity to see it from the inside. He was astonished\\nat the lack of paperwork and what he saw as the simplicity of the company's\\nobjectives - 'selling more beer'.\\nBy contrast, helping to run a country, he suggests, without any attempt to\\nbelittle the daily challenges confronting industry, can be quite\\ncomplicated.\\nHis remarks offer an insight into the cultural differences which have long\\nseparated public service and private enterprise and which many believe\\ncould, if more effectively bridged, help improve Britain's economic\\nperformance.\\nBy spending time with Guinness, Morgan climbed over what the Public Policy\\nUnit has just dubbed the 'Whitehall Wall' - the barrier between government\\nand industry. According to PPU, which monitors and advises on government\\npolicy, the wall is built squarely on lack of understanding, poor\\nexplanation and invariably unhelpful attitudes.\\nA PPU report, published by the Bow Group, the centre-right think tank,\\nconcludes that the government's outlook remains steadfastly inward. It\\nclaims that Whitehall, despite the phased introduction of private sector\\ndisciplines into its revenue-raising operations, has barely started to\\ncomprehend the needs of the enterprise culture which its recent political\\nmasters have tried to spread.\\nIndustry, on the other hand, is accused of paying scant attention to the\\nprocess of policy-making and of invariably leaving responsibility for\\ndealing with government in the hands of unsuitable employees. Companies are\\nurged to regard the task of enlightening government about their activities\\nas a duty and social responsibility.\\nThe system of civil service recruitment does not help. The Civil Service\\nSelection Board, which interviews all the most promising entrants, has no\\nbrief to foster either commercial disciplines or greater empathy between\\ngovernment and governed. Only one in a thousand of those officials entering\\na Whitehall department at the first level of middle management has any\\nworking experience of a commercial environment.\\nThe PPU says that the 'bottom line' to businessmen is financial; their\\nfrustration is with officials who draft policy without fully appreciating\\nthe market consequences of their actions.\\nTop-ranking civil servants are portrayed in the same mould as judges, almost\\nexclusively receiving their training in a cloistered environment both\\ntechnically and culturally removed from the world over which they may\\nexercise profound influence.\\nLord Young, the former Trade and Industry Secretary, criticises the lack of\\ntwo-way traffic: 'Where are the very best of civil servants, who leave and\\ngo into industry in their early forties, as the French do as a matter of\\ncourse? How many in our great companies have the faintest idea how\\ngovernment really works? One or two, not more.\\n'We practice a doctrine of separation of experience that appears absolute.\\nThen we wonder why it is that government has an imperfect understanding of\\nthe needs of commerce and industry.'\\nProgress towards overcoming the ghetto mentality between public and private\\nsectors has been more marked in other, often more vibrant, economies.\\nIn Japan, for example, large numbers of 'Amagari' - or high-flyers - are\\ncontinually seconded from companies to spend up to two years in government\\nministries, which command a far greater status in the eyes of businessmen\\nthan is the case in Britain.\\nIn France, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration provides civil servants with\\ncontextual training intended to provide them with appropriate industrial and\\nbusiness skills. Critics even suggest the system has gone too far, with the\\ndevelopment of equally critical political skills invariably neglected.\\nSporadic attempts in Britain to enhance co-operation and understanding\\nbetween both sides have been under way since 1968. The initiative was\\nrevitalised in 1989 by Lord Young as Trade and Industry Secretary with the\\nlaunch of the Bridge programme.\\nAfter his spell in the brewing industry, Geoffrey Morgan is now an\\nunder-secretary in the Cabinet Office and the man primarily responsible for\\nsecondment.\\nThe British programme is essentially intended for 'rising stars' on both\\nsides. Larger, better-resourced companies tend to dominate the programme but\\nsmaller companies are now being encouraged.\\nWhile many civil servants opt to join companies, as opposed to business\\nsupport organisations or financial institutions, they rarely express an\\ninterest in manufacturing businesses. Among the most popular Whitehall\\ndestinations for corporate employees are the 'economic' departments like the\\nTreasury, DTI and Energy.\\nIn 1989, the Department of Trade and Industry, which employs 12,000 people\\nand is charged with 'assisting the process of wealth creation', despatched\\n41 people to join the wealth-creators. The DTI played host to 46\\nbusinessmen.\\nThe total secondment programme during 1989 saw a total of 627 longer-term\\nplacings on both sides of the Whitehall Wall, along with another 550\\nshort-term attachments. At the same time, 69 civil servants took up\\nnon-executive directorships with companies.\\nA separate, 'short-stay' arrangement, operated by the Whitehall and Industry\\nGroup - a joint venture between industrialists and the Cabinet Office -\\nenables high-calibre civil servants to spend up to three weeks with\\ncompanies, participating at the highest levels of decision-making.\\nBut the strong emphasis placed on quality rather than quantity for the\\noverall secondment programme cannot fully disguise some disappointment\\nwithin government and beyond over the still-limited scale of the initiative.\\nThe Royal Institute of Public Administration, which is concerned with policy\\nmaking and administration in the public sector, has joined calls for the\\nsecondment programme to be expanded and given a higher status by both sides\\nand deplores the sort of attitude which means some companies leave the job\\nto their community affairs or charity sections.\\nChris Bright, a competition lawyer with Linklaters & Paines, the solicitors,\\nrecently finished a two-year spell with the Department of Trade and Industry\\nand enthusiastically supports the initiative. 'My view of the civil service\\nchanged markedly. I got fed up being accused of working from ten o'clock\\nuntil four; the reality was that I had never worked harder in my life.'\\nThough full of admiration for the expertise and dedication of the senior\\ncivil servants with whom he worked, Bright has some kindly criticism.\\n'There is a tendency for people within government departments to over-focus\\non particular issues. They do not always get the broader picture and fail to\\nappreciate the wider impact of the decisions they take.'\\nBright also believes that too many civil servants remain over-sensitive\\nabout publicly imparting information and are suspicious of any scheme which\\nlifts the veil: 'The inbuilt perception among some public servants that the\\npeople should not know certain things is a mentality that must be addressed\\nand overcome.'\\nSusan Gardiner left Customs and Excise to spend two years with P&0\\nContainers and says the experience broadened her entire approach to\\ndecision-making. She says she is 'far more willing to be optimistic' about\\nresolving problems.\\nShe does not believe, however, that the ethos of private sector management\\ncan necessarily be transferred into the civil service, where a wider,\\npolitical perspective is necessary.\\nGardiner would like to see the secondment programme extended but says\\nindustry, too, has to be willing to participate. Businesses might not, she\\nsuggests, always demonstrate the sort of broader, long-term view such a\\ncommitment demands.\\nGiven a civil service more than half a million strong, the Cabinet Office\\nhopes the current rate of secondments can be stepped up. In the meantime,\\none of its biggest challenges is to find companies prepared to take Inland\\nRevenue staff; the quest for mutual understanding does, apparently, have\\nsome boundaries.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3646': \"As a mechanism for disciplining bad management, the hostile takeover has its\\nattractions. But it can be overdone. When the market for corporate control\\nbecomes over-heated, as it did in the mid-1980s, assets are shuffled and\\nre-shuffled for short-term gain and sound companies are damaged in the\\nprocess. Can anything be done to limit the intensity of the next takeover\\nwave?\\nThe outcome of takeover contests would be more rational if the opportunistic\\nelement were reduced and the principal actors - above all, the institutional\\ninvestors whose votes are usually crucial - were forced to focus on the\\nlong-term prospects of the companies concerned. At present, as in the\\nNCR-AT&T case in the US, investors have to sort their way through a stream\\nof one-sided propaganda, accompanied by a series of legal manoeuvres as the\\ncontestants seek to gain advantage.\\nIn these circumstances it is hard to answer the fundamental question - how\\nwell has the defendant management been doing and what is it likely to\\nachieve in the future.\\nOne of the merits of the proposal put forward last year by two American\\nlawyers, Martin Lipton and Steven Rosenblum*, is that it offers a more\\norderly framework in which takeover decisions can be taken. Directors of\\npublic companies would be judged on their performance over five years. At\\neach quinquennial meeting they would offer themselves for re-election on the\\nbasis of a detailed account of their stewardship over the preceding five\\nyears and their plans for the next five; past performance and future\\nprojections would be subject to an appraisal carried out by an independent\\ninvestment bank or consulting firm. Hostile bids could only be considered at\\nthe quinquennial meeting; directors would be free from takeover threats in\\nthe interim, but their jobs would clearly be on the line at the end of each\\nfive-year period.\\nThis approach meets the desire of managers not to be judged solely on\\nshort-term financial results, but without making their lives too\\ncomfortable. They would have to be more open and explicit about their\\nforward plans; their ability to fulfil those plans would be exposed to\\nrigorous public scrutiny.\\nInstitutional shareholders\\nThe usual reaction of City practitioners to the Lipton-Rosenblum paper is\\npolite indifference: do we really need to tear up the existing system just\\nbecause of a few takeover excesses? But a virtue of the proposal is that it\\nbuilds on existing arrangements for reporting to shareholders.\\nUnlike most other proposals for reform, it does not have unrealistic\\nexpectations about changing the behaviour of non-executive directors or\\ninstitutional shareholders. Most institutions have neither the resources nor\\nthe motivation to become 'interested owners', monitoring companies on a\\ncontinuous basis; it is not obvious that the management of those companies\\nwould be improved if they did so.\\nBut shareholders do need reliable information on which to base investment\\njudgments. Just as the proposed accounting changes in the UK would improve\\nthe quality of financial information, so the Lipton-Rosenblum reforms would\\nprovide better insight into overall corporate objectives and performance.\\nThe proposals do involve restrictions in the free market for corporate\\ncontrol. But takeovers, especially those involving large companies, are\\nimportant events with economic and social repercussions.

For\\nsome technical baccalaureats the school week now lasts 40 hours, plus\\nseveral hours' home-work every night. Mr Jospin is now proposing a maximum\\nof 35 hours.\\nThe third component of the Jospin reforms is a simplification of the\\nbaccalaureat syllabuses, so as to get away from the current scourge of\\nhyper-specialisation.\\nAt present there are eight different subject groups for the general\\nbaccalaureat, and 17 for the technological bac; both would be simplified\\ninto three broad streams. In the general bac, the choice would be letters,\\nsocial science, and science, though the curriculum would continue to include\\nsubjects outside the main specialisation.\\nThe main stumbling block for all previous reform efforts has been the\\nresistance of the many teaching unions, and this one is not likely to be an\\nexception.\\nMr Jospin has carefully kept away from any detailed proposals on the content\\nof the baccalaureats; this is the most treacherous ground because it affects\\nthe vested interests of teachers of philosophy, geography, maths, etc. But\\nif Mr Jospin's modest reform is to be implemented, it may require a\\nrevolution in the attitudes and methods of France's teachers.\\nIt looks as if Mr Jospin really does intend to try to reform the\\nhydra-headed monster.

These have been exacerbated by the\\nGulf war, and several privatisations due in the first quarter of the year\\nhave yet to take place.\\nA general election is due by October at the latest and this will\\nincreasingly occupy the minds of ministers.\\nPerhaps the most serious charge is that not enough thought has been given to\\nusing the privatisation process to restructure important parts of the\\neconomy.\\nThe government's answer is that by privatising public companies it is doing\\nprecisely that and strengthening the market economy.\\nCritics are not convinced  - 'privatisations in the financial sector, for\\nexample, are decided piecemeal,' says a leading economist.\\n'There is no overall strategy, but what we need is an active restructuring\\nto prepare quickly the economy for the single (European) market.\\n'The government should intervene selectively to help the formation of\\nPortuguese groups, otherwise we'll miss a unique opportunity.'\",\n",

The deposit was found after World War II by the late Mr Murray\\nWatts, one of Canada's most successful mine finders. He was looking for\\nuranium as well as precious and base metals.\\nFalconbridge bought control of the property in 1957 and spent many millions\\nof dollars outlining the deposit. However, its location north of\\nSchefferville and the northern rail terminus, ruled out development.\\nRaglan is nearly 1,000 miles north east of Montreal and only 60 miles south\\neast of Deception Bay, on Hudson Strait, the shipping point for the former\\nAsbestos Hill mine. During the seventies asbestos fibre was mined openpit\\nand shipped for refining at Nordenheim in Germany until the US Environmental\\nProtection Agency finally knocked the bottom out of the international\\nasbestos market.\\nLast month, the ice-breaking freighter Arctic, used to move zinc ores from\\nthe central Arctic to European refineries, successfully navigated the\\nforbidding ice in Deception Bay, tying up at the old asbestos dock.\\nThis means the old three-month shipping season for asbestos can be extended\\nto eight months, helping Raglan's economics significantly. The mine could\\noperate year-round and production for four months be stockpiled.\\nFalconbridge will spend CDollars 20m at Raglan this year alone and has begun\\na full feasibility study. Most of the money will go for an underground ramp,\\nlateral work and drilling.\\nRaglan is a series of deposits along a 30-mile strike length. Estimated\\nreserves are 18m tonnes averaging 3.13 per cent nickel and 0.88 per cent\\ncopper in one group of mineralised zones. But total reserves are believed\\nmuch larger.\\nIn terms of grade Raglan is the best undeveloped sulphide deposit anywhere,\\nbelieves Falconbridge.\\nThe mine would be a fly-in/fly-out operation. A rail connection with\\nSchefferville was considered in the past, but the rugged terrain makes the\\ncost prohibitive. The tree line ends just north of Schefferville and the\\npermafrost then begins.\\nPotentially, Raglan could increase Falconbridge's annual nickel output by 25\\nto 30 per cent by 1996. Last year Falconbridge produced 62,000 tonnes from\\nits mines in Sudbury, Ontario, and in the Dominican Republic.\\nNickel prices are around USDollars 4 a lb and many forecast tightness in\\nsupply because of problems in the Soviet Union. Together the Soviet Union\\nand Cuba have been supplying between 12 and 15 per cent of western demand.\\nFalconbridge says production in Sudbury and the Dominican Republic will\\nremain flat for the next few years and Raglan would help retain its world\\nmarket share.\",\n",

Peru's important silver mining sector will also\\nbenefit from new 'drawback' measures which allow it to reclaim income and\\nbusiness equity taxes.\\nAlthough the measures were welcomed by Mr Luis Rodriguez Mariategui, head of\\nthe National Mining Society, (SNM), it is not clear whether they are in time\\nto save about 14 medium-sized mines under threat of closure. For example\\nHuaron, a leading silver, zinc and lead producer has been losing Dollars\\n800,000 a month since January and is now said to have debts of almost\\nDollars 13m.\\nWhile plummeting international silver prices mean that silver producers have\\nbeen worst hit, the entire sector is in poor shape. Preliminary figures for\\n1990 indicate that direct losses may be around Dollars 130m, close to those\\nregistered in 1986, the worst year in the last decade. State-owned giant\\nCentromin lost Dollars 50m last year and is contemplating drastic personnel\\ncuts. Only five mining companies reported profits last year, according to\\npreliminary data - Southern Peru Copper, Orcopampa, Milpo, Simsa and Arcata.\\nCopper output fell 13 per cent in 1990 from 1989, while silver and iron\\nproduction declined 15 and 20 per cent respectively. Spare parts and\\nmaintenance problems at HierroPeru, the country's sole iron producer, meant\\na fall in iron output from 2.9m tons in 1989 to 2.1m last year. High\\ninternational metals prices partially masked the crisis - but this year is\\nlikely to be worse, according to industry sources.\\nSpeaking at the close of the national Mining Engineers' Convention in Lima,\\nPresident Fujimori acknowledged the importance of the mining industry. It\\ngenerates over half of all foreign exchange earnings and employs one in five\\nof the population. The solution to the sector's problems, he recognised, lay\\nin a more realistic exchange rate and lower interest rates.\\nThe dollar-inti exchange rate has scarcely moved since December. The inti is\\nover-valued by a factor of three, according to the mining industry. Mr David\\nBallon, president of the Mining Engineers' Institute says the sector has\\nlost Dollars 1.62bn in the last two years alone through exchange rate lag.\\nThis has meant low levels of reinvestment and failure to spend on\\nexploration. Many mines' proven reserves are now perilously low.\\nShort-term debts also plague the sector. Mines have been forced to borrow\\nheavily to pay taxes levied on total sales, rather than profits and run\\nbetween 20 and 30 per cent of turnover. Interest rates exceed 20 per cent a\\nmonth, in spite of a gradual fall in inflation, down to 7.7 per cent last\\nmonth. Mining companies' debt positions have been exacerbated by Centromin's\\nfailure for the past several months to pay suppliers.\\nParticipants from abroad at the convention emphasised the need for Peru to\\nstabilise tax policies and standardise contracts along Chilean lines.\\nTheir call appeared to have been heard by President Fujimori. He promised to\\npromote mining investment under extraordinary facilities recently granted by\\nparliament. This, he said, would make laws 'more flexible,' attract risk\\ncapital and favour joint ventures.\\nIf the main problem for Peruvian miners continues to be the exchange rate,\\nthere is another to which there is no solution yet in sight - terrorism. The\\nSNM counts 304 terrorist actions directed at mining companies during the\\nlast decade, mainly with the object of stealing explosives and other\\nsupplies. Attacks have left 62 dead, it calculates, with a disturbing recent\\nrise - 14 mining employees were killed in remote mountain camps in December\\nlast year alone.\",\n",

'That's the sticking point,' said an NCR official.\\nNCR, the fifth-largest computer manufacturer in the US, has been in\\ndiscussions all weekend with AT&T officials. The NCR board has yet to make\\nany official comment on the proposal announced late on Sunday night.\\nIf AT&T is now in sight of achieving its aim of buying NCR, the only sure\\nwinners are likely to be NCR's own shareholders.\\nThe takeover battle is likely to cost AT&T Dollars 1.36bn more than it\\nbargained for; and there will be no guarantee that AT&T's dreams of building\\na successful global information technology company - spanning computers and\\ncommunications - can be realised.\\nNCR shareholders will have seen the value of their investments increase\\nalmost two and a third times in the past four months if the latest proposal\\ngoes ahead.\\nThey owe thanks for their good fortune to the rugged determination of Mr\\nCharles 'Chuck' Exley, NCR president, to hold out for the best possible\\nprice once it seemed clear there was no hope of resisting AT&T's embrace.\\nIt was not a universally popular attitude. NCR's shareholders interested in\\nthe future of the company as a computer business applaud Mr Exley's apparent\\nintransigence; those who are interested chiefly in realising the value of\\ntheir investment as quickly as possible - Wall Street's arbitrage community\\n -think he has merely been dragging out the inevitable.\\nAT&T's opening bid in December last year - at Dollars 90 a share - valued\\nNCR at Dollars 6.12bn. Although Mr Exley immediately rejected the offer -\\narguing there was no industrial logic in the takeover - he suggested that\\nthe companies could do business if AT&T valued NCR at Dollars 8.5bn or\\nDollars 125 a share.\\nFrom that point, resistance deteriorated into price haggling. Mr Exley\\nreduced his demand to Dollars 110 a share while Mr Robert Allen, chairman of\\nAT&T, raised his offer first to Dollars 100 a share and then two days ago to\\nNCR's asking price. The latest offer values the company at Dollars 7.48bn.\\nUnder AT&T's new proposal, investors would get 2.943 AT&T shares for every\\nNCR share held. AT&T claimed that this was the equivalent of Dollars 110 a\\nshare, based on AT&T's close on Friday.\\nTo protect NCR investors against a future fall in AT&T stock, the bidder\\nsaid it would be willing to offer up to 3.099 shares if the price averaged\\nless than Dollars 37.375 during a 20-day period ahead of an NCR shareholder\\nmeeting to vote on the merger. Yesterday, NCR's shares rose Dollars 5 1/8 to\\nDollars 101 7/8 - well short of the Dollars 110 figure - with AT&T falling\\nDollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 .\\nThe new offer could break the impasse in what has been one of the most\\nbitterly-fought takeover battles the modern computer industry has ever\\nwitnessed. If the offer is accepted, then AT&T will have spent more than\\nDollars 12m in legal fees and NCR about Dollars 7m on its defensive\\nstrategy.\\nFrom the outset, a sizeable proportion of NCR's shareholders had wanted to\\naccept the AT&T bid. AT&T, however, was constrained from simply buying\\nshares in the market by Maryland's takeover laws.\\nNCR showed an appetite for the fight which surprised those familiar with its\\nsleepy marketing methods. It deployed a series of 'poison pill' defences\\nincluding an employee share ownership scheme, which was later declared\\ninvalid.\\nAT&T set up a proxy battle at the NCR shareholders' meeting in March and\\nsucceeded in ousting four directors, including the chairman.\\nAT&T's battle for NCR is, however, likely to prove only the beginning of a\\nvery long road for North America's largest telecommunications company.\\nThe history of mergers between large electronics groups is stained with red\\nink and littered with failures.\\nUnisys, for example, the world's fifth-largest computer company forged five\\nyears ago from parts of Sperry and the Burroughs Corporation, lost Dollars\\n436m in 1990. It is still struggling to resolve the problem of two\\ncompletely different product families.\\nSiemens-Nixdorf, put together just over 12 months ago from the loss-making\\nNixdorf and the barely-profitable computer operations of Siemens, is\\nexpected to lose money this year. It is proving difficult to find common\\nground between the radically different cultures of the two companies.\\nGroupe Bull, which two years ago took over the US personal computer\\nmanufacturer, Zenith, has been experiencing similar problems. This is\\ndespite Groupe Bull's declared intention to manage the company at arms\\nlength from the rest of its computer operations.\\nGroupe Bull is being propped up with FFr4bn (Pounds 397m) of investment from\\nits largest shareholder, the French government.\\nFurthermore, over the past decade both AT&T and International Business\\nMachines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, have made abortive\\nefforts to invade each other's territory.\\nAT&T's basic plan is to merge its small and unsuccessful computer business\\ninto NCR, leaving the Ohio-based company essentially alone to manage the\\nbusiness. Superficially, it is an attractive idea.\\nFor a new computer company to stand a chance of success today it must:\\nHave identified a market niche in which it can be a leader;\\nOffer products based on low-cost, standard microprocessor chips;\\nOffer 'open' systems based on standard operating software; Have firm control\\nof 'channels' - dealers, value-added resellers and software houses who\\nprovide the conduit between the manufacturers and their customers.\\nAT&T developed, and owns copyright on, the software system, Unix, which most\\nmanufacturers now agree will become the industry standard for open systems.\\nNCR, alone among the large computer manufacturers, has taken the plunge into\\ndesigns based on low-cost microprocessors and the Unix operating system.\\nDespite the fact that it is not among the world's top 10 computer\\nmanufacturers, NCR is a leading supplier of financial systems and dominates\\nthe market for automated teller machines - 'holes-in-the-wall'.\\nNCR, which began as a manufacturer of cash registers in the 1800s, would\\ngive AT&T's computer ambitious a powerful fillip through its distribution\\nchannels. It has already been identified by Europe's largest manufacturers\\nas a potential route into the US market.\\nThe big question is whether it will be possible for the staff of two such\\ndifferent companies to work together profitably.\\nAT&T has no record of success in computers. Its computer division turns over\\nabout Dollars 1.5bn a year and loses about Dollars 200m.\\nA merger with NCR may be its last chance.

Yet for the election due next month Mr Rajiv Gandhi, inheritor\\nof the leadership of the founding Congress party, is fighting on a manifesto\\nthat promises both a programme of privatisation and a cut in government\\nspending.\\nIt is hard to maintain the secular ideal. The revivalist Bharatiya Janata\\nParty, BJP, trades upon the paradoxical feelings among Hindus that although\\nthey are the overwhelming majority they are somehow threatened by Moslems,\\nSikhs, and other minorities. This reaches deep into the psyche of many\\nHindus. Indian acquaintances of wide erudition and a cosmopolitan mien have\\nconfided to me that they see a point in BJP's proposal to construct a Hindu\\ntemple on a site claimed by Moslems. Mr Gandhi needs Moslem votes and cannot\\nplay the Hindu card, but he has offered a compromise on job reservation for\\nlower castes, offering to support a scheme without giving figures.\\nAs to national unity and international status, post-war Indian foreign\\npolicy has been firmly based on cementing a special relationship with the\\nSoviet Union. But now we live in a one-superpower world, and any outside\\nacquiescence in bloody attempts to repress secessionist movements will\\ndepend upon the US. There is not much point in being non-aligned if there is\\nno balance of power within which not to align yourself. During the Gulf war\\nIndia managed to offend almost every party - its old friends, the Iraqis, by\\ndoing nothing, and its potential business partners, the Americans, by\\ncutting off overflying rights to refuel at Bombay.\\nIt will be difficult to mend such broken fences until the election produces\\na new government, probably a coalition, possibly led by Mr Gandhi. The first\\nstep, however, will be to produce a budget, postponed for electoral reasons,\\nand the step after that will be to sit down with India's creditors. This is\\nwhere outsiders, like the IMF and the World Bank, have some leverage. They\\nwill not provide cash without strings. But how far should conditionality go?\\nIt is in everyone's interest to strengthen Indian democracy, and - as the\\nGulf war and its aftermath show - it is the prevailing fashion to maintain\\nexisting boundaries however colonialist their origins. But Indians are\\nindependent-minded people. They need not follow fashion. They would be wise\\nat least to loosen their tight republic and replace it with a true\\nfederation, or, better, confederation - in short, to decentralise\\nadministration outwards and far away from Delhi.\\nThe new government should state its intentions about economic\\nliberalisation, and clear its mind about whether it welcomes inward\\ninvestment or seeks to drive it away by the sheer weight of obstructive\\nbureaucracy. I have anecdotal evidence about an Indian mega-millionaire who\\nmade his money in the US and wanted to invest Dollars 250m back home but\\nwithdrew after three months of frustrated attempts to meet the demands of\\nthe Indian civil service. There is a huge wealth of talent and drive among\\nIndia's 850m people. They need to shed the remaining burden of the Raj, even\\ntake the risk that in the end some of them go their separate ways, if they\\nare to realise their potential.\",\n",

       " 'FT911-3726': \"Three sleek new airliners, their fresh paint glinting in the spring\\nCalifornian sunshine, sit on the 'flight ramp' - the very end of the\\nproduction line at McDonnell Douglas's Long Beach plant - surrounded by a\\nclutter of equipment as workers prepare the jets for final delivery.\\nThey are among the first dozen production models of a wide-bodied,\\nthree-engined jet - the MD-11 - to roll off the commercial aircraft line. To\\nMcDonnell Douglas, these jets, and 34 other MD-11s due for delivery this\\nyear, represent much more than routine aircraft sales. To the management at\\nLong Beach, where McDonnell makes its civilian aircraft, they provide hope\\nthat the chronic problems that have plagued the plant for years are being\\nsolved. And at the group's headquarters in St Louis, Missouri, the sales are\\na kind of financial poetry in motion: each departing Dollars 100m (Pounds\\n55.8m) jet brings in huge amounts of cash flow which the company believes\\nwill extricate it from a tight corner by the end of this year.\\nFor McDonnell Douglas, the largest defence contractor in the US and one of\\nthe western world's three leading civilian aircraft manufacturers, has a\\nstretched balance sheet. In 1990 much more cash - some Dollars 400m - flowed\\nout of the business than came in.\\nIronically, just when the company has been basking in the success of its\\nweapons systems in the Gulf war, a succession of blows has left some\\nPentagon officials and industry observers questioning whether it could even\\nbecome a contender for bankruptcy or a government bail-out.\\nMr John McDonnell, the company's bearded, 53-year-old chairman and the son\\nof its founder, says the Cassandras are just plain wrong. 'We've taken a lot\\nof strong measures to improve cash flow and they are taking effect,' he\\nsays. 'By the end of this year our cash flow will be getting quite positive\\nand our debt will be going down, and it will be obvious to everyone that\\nwe're getting in a much stronger financial situation.'\\nBut in 1990 the company reported net earnings of only Dollars 306m on\\nrevenues of Dollars 16bn, while at year-end its debts, excluding its\\nfinancing arm, totalled Dollars 3bn, or 95 per cent of its equity. Nor is\\nthe quality of its earnings very impressive: some Dollars 376m of 1990\\nprofits came from a one-time pensions settlement, while the company is in\\ndispute with the government over military contracts which could eventually\\nmean writing off hundreds of millions of dollars.\\nThe most serious dispute stems from January's decision by Mr Dick Cheney,\\nthe US defence secretary, to cancel development of the A-12 attack aircraft,\\na potential Dollars 50bn programme being jointly developed by McDonnell\\nDouglas and General Dynamics. The two contractors, having already taken\\nlarge write-offs on the A-12, are now locked in litigation over Dollars\\n1.3bn of progress payments which the Pentagon wants back.\\nEven if McDonnell's finances are now improving, with a reported profit of\\nDollars 58m for the three months to March 31 this year, against only Dollars\\n2m for a year earlier, it faces a difficult long-term juggling act: its\\ncombat aircraft business, which for years has made up for the weak financial\\nperformance of the commercial side, is shrinking inexorably as the US cuts\\nits defence budget.\\nThe Gulf war is unlikely to bring in much fresh business - apart from a\\nreplenishment of the Tomahawk cruise missiles. And while McDonnell remains\\nthe leading US manufacturer of combat aircraft, several models - the F-15\\nEagle, the Harrier II AV-8B and the Apache helicopter - are nearing the end\\nof their Pentagon production programmes.\\nAn announcement is expected today on the air force's choice to succeed the\\nF-15. The contenders are a Northrop-McDonnell partnership and one comprising\\nLockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics. Worth Dollars 64.6bn, according to\\nthe Pentagon, the contract for the advanced tactical fighter, the ATF, is\\nvital to McDonnell Douglas. This month it lost out to a rival\\nBoeing-Sikorsky consortium for the US army's new light attack helicopter\\ncontract.\\nWhichever way the ATF contest is decided, it is clear that McDonnell's\\nfuture is becoming more dependent on Long Beach and its ability to develop\\nprofitably new generations of civilian aircraft in competition against the\\nlarger, more efficient Boeing and European Airbus Industrie.\\nLong Beach, in common with rival manufacturers, has a strong order-book  -\\nparticularly for wide-bodied jets - though in recent months the industry has\\nbecome nervous because of deferrals and cancellations by airline customers.\\nBut the plant has been an Achilles heel since the Californian Douglas\\ncompany merged with McDonnell in 1967, losing money for much of the past 15\\nyears.\\nIts profits record might be blamed in part on the competitive pressures of\\nthe aerospace industry, but insiders suggest it results substantially from\\nyears of poor productivity and lack of discipline. The plant's management\\ndid not have a sufficient grasp on real production costs, while suppliers\\ncomplained about bureaucracy and inefficiency in the purchasing system.\\nAll these problems were exacerbated in the mid-1980s as Long Beach tried to\\ncope not only with making the aircraft it already had in production - the\\nMD-80 twin-engine jet and the now discontinued DC-10 wide-bodied aircraft -\\nbut also with a rush of new developments: there was the MD-11, the successor\\nto the DC-10; the MD-90, a follow-on from the MD-80; the C-17, a new\\ngeneration of military transport aircraft specially designed for use on\\nshort runways; and the T45, a naval training aircraft.\\nDespite these new ventures, McDonnell Douglas's family of commercial\\naircraft is less comprehensive than that of Boeing and the developing Airbus\\nfleet. Unlike its two principal competitors, it has no presence in the\\nmiddle range of the market, but is concentrated at the lower end, with the\\nMD-80, and at the top with the MD-11. McDonnell and Airbus missed a chance\\nto challenge Boeing two years ago by failing to agree to co-operate on new\\naircraft production. Now McDonnell is understood to be actively looking for\\nan equity partner to buy a minority stake in the commercial jet side of the\\nbusiness.\\nMeanwhile, as the company struggled to meet its commercial aircraft\\ncommitments and programmes, staff levels were rising. At Long Beach, the\\nworkforce went from just 12,000 in 1982 to 52,000 in 1989. As it did the\\nexperience level of the average worker dropped from 10 years to two.\\nProblems multiplied and the plant's development schedule lagged.\\nAt this point Mr McDonnell, who became chairman in early 1988, decided that\\nthe entire group needed a radical overhaul of its management systems. A new\\nexecutive team, drawn from across the company, was despatched to Long Beach\\nlast year, headed by Mr Bob Hood. The new management approach aims to\\nimprove productivity and customer satisfaction by stripping away\\nbureaucracy, pushing greater powers of decision-making down the line, and\\ncreating greater motivation and inter-departmental co-operation through the\\nformation of teams. Called Total Quality Management System (TQMS), and\\ninspired by the Japanese, it has been adopted by several other leading US\\nmanufacturers.\\n'We started from ground zero,' recalls Mr Hood. Departments were reshaped\\ninto teams working on individual products, drawing together people from\\ndifferent disciplines. Management layers were cut from nine to five and the\\nnew leaders were selected with an emphasis on what Mr Hood calls their\\nability to 'coach and listen' rather than 'old-style dictatorial\\nmanagement'.\\nOver the longer term, the changes may well prove to be the salvation of Long\\nBeach. In the short term, they produced more confusion, demoralisation and\\ndelays. TQMS was introduced gradually and quite successfully at McDonnell's\\nSt Louis division, but was imposed virtually overnight at Long Beach.\\nMatters became so bad that Colonel Kenneth Tollefson, the air force\\nrepresentative overseeing the C-17 programme, wrote an article in the staff\\nnewspaper accusing management of lack of leadership.\\nMorale at the plant still seems shaky, and union relations delicate, but\\nover the past year progress on the MD-80 and MD-11 lines does suggest that\\nthe shake-up is starting to produce better results. For example,\\nproductivity on the MD-80 improved by more than 30 per cent in 1990 and is\\nstill getting better. For the first time in its history that aircraft has\\nenjoyed two consecutive money-making quarters, with a third coming up.\\nAll this has not saved the MD-11 from some recent embarrassing criticism\\nfrom Mr Robert Crandall, the chairman of American Airlines, who was unhappy\\nwith the first aircraft delivered to his company. Mr Crandall's complaints\\nseem to involve some easily fixable and relatively minor glitches, and\\nAmerican says the problems do not alter its enthusiasm for the MD-11.\\nA far larger Long Beach dispute, which could have a significant impact on\\nthe group's profits and balance sheet, concerns the C-17, which is behind\\nschedule and looks likely to come in over the Dollars 6.6bn fixed-price\\ncontract McDonnell Douglas accepted from the air force. The air force,\\nclaiming that McDonnell is Dollars 500m above the ceiling, withheld progress\\npayments late last year and Pentagon officials were recently quoted as\\nsaying that the project might now be Dollars 800m to Dollars 900m over\\nbudget.\\nMcDonnell, however, reckons the aircraft will come in only Dollars 100m\\nabove the ceiling. Mr Herb Lanese, the company's senior vice-president,\\nfinance, says the two sides are working on new figures and insists that 'the\\nperformance indicators at this time are a lot closer to our numbers than to\\nthe air force's'.\\nThe Pentagon's withholding of Dollars 900m last year for work on the C-17\\nand the cancelled A-12 has contributed significantly to McDonnell's cash\\nsqueeze, as has the tightness of the capital markets, restricting cheap\\naccess to funds for a company with a low investment-grade credit rating. But\\nthe main factor has been the Dollars 3bn cost of developing the MD-11 -\\nroughly the same as the group's entire equity base.\\nHowever, Mr Lanese says the financial picture is on the point of improving\\nsubstantially and that March probably saw the peak of the company's\\nborrowing needs. At the end of the first quarter McDonnell's debt totalled\\nabout Dollars 3.3bn, with some Dollars 370m of cash on hand, against net\\nequity of Dollars 3.5bn. With loan covenants setting a ceiling of just over\\nDollars 4bn on total borrowings, the company still has a sizeable ability to\\nraise funds.\\nThe improving cash position is due in part to MD-11 sales but also to a\\ncompany-wide savings drive: working capital is being slashed, the dividend\\nhas been reduced and capital spending curtailed. The MD-11 production\\nschedule has also been cut - by five aircraft this year, from 42 to 37,\\nhelping save on parts and labour costs.\\nAll this does suggest that the direst predictions are overdone. That said,\\nMcDonnell's room for manoeuvre will remain tight for the rest of this year,\\nand there are several wild cards - a Dollars 500m tax claim, the C-17 and\\nlabour issues - which could yet cause it severe headaches.\\nNext year cash flow is likely to turn positive, but the heat will still be\\non McDonnell's management: to improve Long Beach productivity; to find funds\\nto develop the next wide-bodied jet - a stretched version of the MD-11\\ncalled the MD-12X which will compete with the Boeing 747-400; and to handle\\nthe tricky transfer of resources from fighter to commercial aircraft.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3727': \"ANYONE seeking a lesson in the most productive ways to manage workers would\\nbe unlikely to look first to Britain. Failure to engage the skills and\\ncommitment of workers effectively has been a longstanding problem for\\nindustry. In the 1970s, the symptom of this British disease was industrial\\naction. In the 1990s, it is unemployment caused by inability to contain wage\\ngrowth.\\nMr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, nonetheless believes Britain\\nhas a story to tell. He yesterday praised companies for promoting employee\\ninvolvement. Instead of following rigid European practice, companies were\\nfinding their own ways of raising productivity through worker involvement.\\nMr Howard's point is that British companies are already addressing this\\ntricky issue without having to be forced to do so by the European\\nCommission. He suggested that the Council of Ministers accepts a vaguely\\nworded endorsement of worker participation in place of the Commission's\\ndraft directive on European works councils. This would avoid large employers\\nhaving to establish European consultation mechanisms.\\nPart of Mr Howard's motive was no doubt political. The government has played\\non its resistance to what it regards as the Commission's plan to smother the\\nSingle European Market in the red tape of the social action programme. Mr\\nJohn Major has less taste for such public carping than Mrs Thatcher, but Mr\\nHoward believes he is on firm ground, given the undoubted hostility of\\nBritish employers to the draft directive.\\nOverblown rhetoric\\nThe political motivation accounts for some of the overblown rhetoric.\\nCompanies employing more than 1,000 people and more than 100 in at least two\\nEC countries would no doubt find it irritating to have to pay for regular\\npan-European briefing meetings. Many might question their value, but the\\ndirective would hardly force them into full-blown co-determination.\\nOne reason why the fears appear exaggerated is the long history of the\\ndirective. It is a descendant of more ambitious attempts to impose worker\\nparticipation, including the Vredeling directive of 1980. But its roots are\\nmisleading: the European Commission no longer sees itself applying the\\nGerman model across the Community. Most of today's debate revolves around\\nthe entirely valid objective of increasing managerial effectiveness and\\ncorporate success.\\nCode of practice\\nMr Howard could do more to catch this mood. For example a code of practice\\non employee involvement has already been drawn up by the Institute of\\nPersonnel Management and the Involvement and Participation Association. Mr\\nHoward should consider endorsing it.\\nBut such signals of encouragement to employee involvement are the limit of\\nwhat governments should do. Legislation is not the right way to define or\\nenforce good management practice. This is as true of employee communication\\nas it is of the structure of company boards or the planning of a production\\nline. Inflexible models of how managers should inform workers will not\\nincrease good communication.\\nMuch of this legislative intent at the European level is, in any case,\\nclearly outdated. Not only European governments, but US management\\nconsultants now preach the virtues of involving employees in production\\nsystems and quality control; wise managements keep workers informed and\\nlisten to what they say. Japanese team-working methods and quality circles\\nare among the clearest pieces of evidence that worker involvement can bring\\na financial pay-off.\\nThe market is thus already deciding in favour of involvement. Changes in\\nworking methods to suit more complex production processes are already making\\nit more difficult to sustain a clear divide between managers and the\\nmanaged. This is something for governments to encourage if they want to\\nachieve economic success. It cannot be imposed through inflexible\\nlegislation, no matter how well intentioned.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3728': \"The True North is the self-consciously evocative, not to say portentous\\ntitle of the exhibition that now fills the upper tier of the Barbican Art\\nGallery (until June 16: sponsored by The Daily Telegraph and Air Canada).\\nBut while its sub-title, 'Canadian landscape painting 1896 - 1939', might\\nwell give us pause, with thoughts inevitable of something more frozen, dull\\nand provincial than exciting, for once the more hopeful expectation is not\\ndisappointed. As is so often the case with national schools, Canadian\\npainting has been for far too long too well-kept a secret, to the general\\nloss. What the Barbican now offers us is quite simply, within its own terms,\\nas intriguing and physically enjoyable a show of well-made, honest paintings\\nas we could wish for.\\nThe study of art is littered in paradox, not the least of them that which\\nsuggests that the more national, even local the work might be, the wider its\\ngeneral interest and significance. So steeped are we in the idea of Paris as\\nthe very heart of modernism through all its earlier phases, that we too\\neasily accept that franco-centric reading at its own self-valuation, seeing\\neverything else as but second-hand, second-best and provincial. But, paradox\\nagain, Paris was indeed at the heart of things, and artists came from across\\nthe world to see and respond to what was being done, and measure their own\\nart by its standards.\\nThe traffic was ever all ways, and in the first decades of this century many\\nof these expatriates clearly held much in common in that was quite distinct\\nfrom Paris. The more worldly and knowing, the more true to themselves they\\nwere. The Canadians were no exception in this, but they might as well have\\nbeen Scots or Scandinavians, Spaniards or Mexicans, Americans or even\\nJapanese. The mistake was only to forget, or rather discount the fact that\\nartists went on working wherever they were, thinking of home when they were\\nin Paris, and quite often remembering Paris when they were home.\\nBut while this question of national self-identity is common-place, it is\\ntrue that it has concerned Canadians to a peculiar degree. The looming,\\nover-bearing presence of the US, the sense of existing along a narrow\\nsouthern fringe with, at their back, the immense wilderness stretching\\nendlessly away to the Farthest North, has always concentrated their minds\\nwonderfully. In their artists it must surely account for the often\\nself-consciously exhortatory quality of their writings, urging each other\\ntowards a position that is truly Canadian; for the constant groupings and\\nregroupings of clubs and societies; and above all, for the epic and\\ncelebratory aspect of so much of the work in this exhibition. This last\\nespecially is a quality held in common with certain of the contemporary\\nScandinavian and Icelandic painters, but here so much more forceful and\\nintense.\\nThe show begins with the work of the young artists who were in Paris well\\nbefore the turn of the century, where they they were able to respond\\ndirectly to impressionism in its later moods and phases, and to early\\ndevelopments in post-impressionism. These are not the most dramatic images,\\nbut their accomplishment and sophistication are incontestable, two views of\\n1906 by Maurice Cullen, across the St Lawrence river to and from Quebec, as\\nsubtle and exquisite in their suggestive tonality as any Monet, and the most\\nbeautiful in the entire show. Suzor-Cote, Clarence Gagnon and James Morrice,\\nmake up this first most distinctive and distinguished group.\\nBut the best known group, and indeed central to the whole study of Canadian\\npainting in the early 20th century, is the Group of Seven, which came\\ntogether informally in the 1910s and formally constituted itself just after\\nthe Great War. With certain individual artists loosely associated with it,\\nsuch as Tom Thomson who died in 1917 and, much later, Emily Carr, it\\naddressed itself consciously to the landscape not merely as a visible\\nphenomenon, but as a moral force.\\nIn the work of all the Seven: Harris, MacDonald, Lismer, Jackson, Varley,\\nJohnston and Carmichael, the landscape takes on an almost mystical presence,\\nnot personal exactly but alive in its physicality, the space across the\\nlake, the form over the mountain febrile in definition, fraught with\\nfeeling. Cloud, mountain, lake and forest alike are simplified and\\ncelebrated almost as symbol and totem, the individual tree or rock itself\\nbecome a monument. But there is rather more to it than simple symbolic\\nsignification. The works are beautifully painted, and with a raw but\\ncontained energy in the drawing, and rich paint on the surface. Landscape,\\nimage and experience alike are beautifully observed, realised and felt.\\nAs much is true of the work of Tom Thomson, perhaps more so, which is as\\nimpressive as anything here, though shown separately by the accident of his\\nearly death. If the exhibition does nothing more than establish his wider\\nreputation, it will have been worthwhile.\\nThe show is rounded off by the later work of those artists who continued, by\\nEmily Carr's overt symbolism, by younger artists such as Charles Comfort,\\nand by perhaps the most idiosyncratic and particular of them all, David\\nMilne, whose delicately mannered touch exquisitely combines any number of\\nmodernisms, from impressionism on.\\nBack to the Seven for a moment, Arthur Lismer and Frederick Varley were both\\nfrom Sheffield and their work is the subject of a coincidental exhibition,\\nOur Home and Native Land, organised by the Sheffield City Art Galleries,\\nwhich comes to Canada House next month (May 3 to June 18).

During the past season, though,\\nBoston and Cambridge have provided the artist, who will be 50 this year,\\nwith two opportunities for world premieres that will travel across the\\ncountry. They mark a new stage in his career.\\nWilson's stock-in-trade is to give concrete form to a combination of\\nvisionary images and gestures gleaned from daily observation. Placed in a\\ntheatrical, indeed operatic setting, these fragments are made to cohere by a\\nthird ingredient - the attention and imagination of his audience.\\nIn many ways, he is closer to Wagner than Ionesco, for though the absurd may\\nbe buried in the material, it is the epic themes and variations,\\nrepetitiously unfurled during long performances like those of Einstein on\\nthe Beach, that shape the disjointed parts into a memorable whole. And even\\nwhere a performance may lag, there is the architecture of the set and his\\npainterly use of light that make the experience more than just a worthwhile\\nrepresentation.\\nAt the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Robert Wilson's Vision, the first\\nretrospective of the artist's work in a decade, is as much a performance as\\nan exhibition. And across the Charles River in Cambridge, the American\\nRepertory Theatre at Harvard premiered Wilson's production of Henrik Ibsen's\\nlast play, When We Dead Awaken, which will now be moving with the exhibition\\nto Houston, Texas, and, one would hope, to other cities here and abroad.\\nAs is often the case, an outside discipline can channel creativity into\\nunusual depths, and here an 1899 play (Wilson usually writes his own\\nscripts), whose symbolist themes are compatible with Wilson's techniques,\\nhas given the director a chance to cut loose in amazing ways. Not the least\\nof these are the inclusion of some hauntingly beautiful blues songs,\\ncomposed and sung by tap dancer Charles 'Honi' Coles, sometimes with the\\nwhole cast, during the 'Knee Plays', the brief performances in the intervals\\nthat are the joints between the acts. Both the exhibition and the play are\\naccompanied by sound environments composed by Wilson's longtime\\ncollaborator, Hans Peter Kuhn.\\nIn designing the exhibition, a work of installation art in itself, Wilson\\ncreated a journey through three major galleries that, like any classical\\ndrama, suggests the passage of a single day. 'The Night before the Day,' as\\nhe calls the installation, features objects and furniture used as props,\\ndrawings, paintings, maquettes and actual sets from his past productions.\\nThe entrance through a long dark corridor sounds like a wind tunnel with\\ndistant bird calls and leads to a room the colour of dawn, where, among\\nother objects, his hanging wire mesh chairs and tables are doubled by their\\nperfect shadows on the walls. Such objects as the Japanese-style puppets,\\nused in 'Knee Plays' during CIVIL WarS, and the glass and neon light bulb\\nfrom Death Destruction and Detroit are elegant in themselves though somehow\\ndenuded of their active stage roles.\\nMore illuminating are the black-and-white drawings of his stage designs that\\nconvey with solid and luminously transparent planes the great sense of stage\\ndistance he achieves. One drawing, for 'A Letter for Queen Victoria,'\\ndemonstrates how something as simple as the back of an envelope can inspire\\nthe diagonals of his stage design. The final gallery, dark as night, is\\naglow with the moving lights of the grid - like the interior of the\\nspaceship from the climax of Einstein on the Beach: being so close to it\\nfulfils an audience fantasy of wanting to be in it.\\nHaving recently seen a more traditional production of When We Dead Awaken\\nperformed by the Jean Cocteau Repertory in New York, I am convinced that\\nWilson has given a more thoughtful and penetrating interpretation of this\\nenigmatic play, which Ibsen saw as the epilogue of his previous works. The\\nnew translation is by Robert Brustein, the ART's artistic director.\\nRubek, the famous but ageing sculptor who attempts to rekindle his creative\\nspark, rejects his young, earthy but boring wife, Maya, for a kind of\\nspiritual meeting with the model, Irene, who inspired his greatest work and\\nwho may or may not be alive. The sets of mountainous seaside scenes, with\\nrivers of glass and glacial peaks are realistic enough and make one sense\\nthe starkness of the terrain. The 'music' of clanking metal and roaring sea\\nevokes a desolate landscape as well. But the constructions, as of a metal\\ncage cum labyrinth where Irene and her keeper, here her inner self, take\\ninterminable walks, add to the psychological force of the dialogue.\\nThe sets and costumes recall the sombre beauty of 19th-century Scandinavian\\nlandscape and figure painting. Wilson has hewed to the force of the script\\nand each act takes his audience higher into the mountains in a natural\\nascent to the fatal avalanche. The line from Charles 'Honi' Coles' first\\nsong - 'I was alone when I met her/ Now I wish I was alone' - becomes a good\\nrefrain for the play.\\nWhen We Dead Awaken will be presented by the Alley Theatre in Houston,\\nTexas, May 22 - May 26.

This is much rarer than it ought to be; and even individually,\\nthe fortunes of the symphonies are mixed - the First ('Classical') and Fifth\\nare played a lot, the Sixth slightly less often, and the remaining four very\\nlittle.\\nIn addition, the chance to hear the seven given in chronological order, as\\nthe two BBC Philharmonic weekends allow, tells one a great deal not only\\nabout the development of an important composer, but much that is central to\\nthe whole notion of a 'Russian Spring' in music. For, while Prokofiev may\\nnot have been a revolutionary composer in any committed ideological sense,\\nit is in his brilliant, audacious, and copious musical outpourings that we\\ncome to appreciate most fully the trends of the immediate pre and\\npost-Revolutionary period.\\nThe BBC Philharmonic under Edward Downes played the 'Classical' and the\\nSecond on Saturday evening (separated by Nikolay Demidenko's superlatively\\nfine account, technically impeccable, formidable, sparklingly witty, of the\\nFirst Piano Concerto) and the Third and Fourth on Sunday afternoon (the rest\\nfollow, in similar programme divisions and timings, next weekend). The\\n'Classical' (1916-17) is a jeu d'esprit indicative of the saucy wit and love\\nof 18th-century forms and counterpoint that would stamp Prokofiev all his\\nlife. But from there to the Second is a big, fascinating step; and under\\nDownes's sympathetic and knowledgeable guidance it was rewarding to be able\\nto take it.\\nThe following three works, all scored for gigantic forces, are stepchildren\\nof the repertory; the Second (1924-5), a piece of steel-and-smoke musical\\nmachinery unparalleled in Prokofiev's output, is the most neglected and\\nmisunderstood of the trio - unsuccessful at its Paris premiere, apt to be\\ndismissively viewed even now.\\nThe title of Mossolov's notorious short ballet, Iron Foundry, could with\\nsome aptness serve as its subtitle, though in the second movement, a set of\\ntheme and variations, there is relief, of a quietly and mysteriously\\nbeautiful kind, from the pounding, braying and chains of dissonances (all of\\nwhich Downes and his orchestra clarified with masterly patience).\\nThe Second is not exactly a decorous or tidy piece of symphonic construction\\n(Prokofiev never got round to revising or re-scoring it, as he planned). But\\nin a carefully considered performance such as we heard on Saturday, the\\nwealth of combative, rhythmically intricate, densely vibrant material it\\ncontains can knock an audience sideways.\\nThe next two symphonies gained their existence via a different route: both\\nare re-thinkings of existent material, the one operatic, the other balletic,\\nand so it is understandable that both, while no less thunderous at climaxes,\\nshould be cleaner and trimmer in their proportions. And both, in their\\ndifferent and more mature ways, seem to mark the most artistically striking\\npoint of balance between the 'iconoclastic' Prokofiev and the 'popular'.\\nBoth contain extraordinarily rich and exciting invention: their blends of\\nsounds and harmonies - intense, pungent, and sweepingly lyrical by turns -\\nare like no other I know. The Third (1928) is the symphony that Prokofiev\\ndrew from the opera The Fiery Angel (which Downes will be conducting - happy\\nnews] - at Covent Garden in two seasons' time); the Fourth (1929-30, revised\\n1947) is an adaptation and extension of material from the ballet The\\nProdigal Son.\\nWhether or not Prokofiev was a symphonist in the traditionally understood\\nsense is a question that has been hotly debated before, and will no doubt be\\nagain; but it seems to me that, particularly in the Third, with its\\ndepiction of worlds earthly and demonic, of states of mind 'normal' and\\nwildly out of kilter, a discourse of confronted opposites is very much in\\nthe fabric of its four movements. While the Fourth does not grip the\\nlistener in quite the same way, the diversity of its sound-worlds -\\ncomic-pastoral, sparkishly jazzy, and broadly melodic - is even more\\nimmediate in its appeal.\\nI formed the impression, perhaps unjustly, that of all the works on the bill\\nof the first BBCPO weekend, the Fourth had been the one least precisely\\nprepared. There were patches of scrappy ensemble, and it was here that one\\nnoticed most often the orchestra's relative narrowness of string tone (the\\nbrass played expertly throughout). But in Downes's hands, lack of orchestral\\ninflation was an interpretative feature, and a wholly positive one, of both\\nconcerts: while performances of more extravagantly virtuosic, or 'Russian',\\ncharacterisation are easily imagined, those of more musicianly style and\\nsubstance can hardly be.

Yesterday's debate was a routine occasion for a\\nbackbencher's choice of subject.\\nMr MacGregor points out that so far 34 bills have been launched in the\\n1990-91 session, compared with 26 in the 1989-90 period and 30 the year\\nbefore.\\nIn terms of controversy and length, the picture is slightly different.\\nThe Commons will indeed be disposing of four bills this week, but\\ndiscussions on bills dealing with Scottish natural heritage and the atomic\\nweapons establishment are unlikely to attract full houses.\\nEvery year has some politically inconsequential measures, such as the\\nOverseas Superannuation Bill which the Commons passed almost without\\nnoticing, but most sessions have blockbusters as well.\\nOnly the Criminal Justice Bill this year is comparable with heavyweights\\nsuch as last year's legislation on broadcasting, environmental issues and\\nhealth service reforms.\\nAlongside the deliberate pre-election mix of bills, MPs are also benefiting\\nfrom Mr MacGregor's positive management of the programme.\\nIn refusing to allow his colleagues to hijack bills and expand them to\\noverflow the time provided, and in creating special committees to leave most\\nEuropean Community legislation to the enthusiasts, he has lightened two\\ntraditional scourges of backbenchers in search of more time with their\\nfamilies.\\nOutside factors have also helped. Ministers mention MPs' pre-occupation with\\nthe Gulf, and with local government elections and finance. The most\\neffective distraction, however, was the one that dares not speak its name -\\nthe Tory leadership contest in November.\\nWhile the Tory party went through the most dramatic political events in most\\npoliticians' memories, in just a fortnight, the Commons went through all\\nstages of three bills and the second readings of five others.\\nEven after Mrs Thatcher's departure, politics continued to dominate over\\ngovernment.

       " 'FT911-3734': \"BACK in 1981 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher first pushed for the abolition of\\ndomestic rates, Mr Michael Heseltine offered a simple solution to her most\\npressing concern.\\nThe then environment secretary told the then prime minister that if her main\\nworry was the high bills faced by little old ladies living alone in large\\nhouses, the answer was simple. He would make local authorities give them a\\nbig discount.\\nThe rest is history. Mrs Thatcher did not take his advice. Mr Heseltine\\nmoved on and then out of the Cabinet. The prime minister solved her problem\\nby replacing the rates with the poll tax. Mr Heseltine pushed her out of\\nDowning Street.\\nToday Mr Heseltine, back at environment under a new prime minister, will\\noutline his plan to replace the poll tax with a property tax which provides\\na 25 per cent discount to little old ladies living alone in large houses.\\nThe important details have already emerged; and despite of talk of further\\nconsultation, the scheme will represent a firm proposal rather than an\\noption.\\nAt first glance it looks a neat synthesis of political imperatives and\\neconomic logic, though the realistic in Whitehall are still unsure of how\\nstrong the joins are.\\nThe tax will be levied on property classified in seven bands according to\\ncapital value. Bills will be applied to households - with an assumption that\\nthey contain two adults - rather than to individuals. The poorest will be\\nexempted entirely.\\nThe present system of grant distribution using Standard Spending Assessments\\nwill remain as will draconian 'capping' powers to prevent 'excessive'\\nspending by local authorities. There is little talk nowadays of preserving\\n'local democracy'.\\nThe economic logic is there in the fact that a property tax restores some\\nrelationship between individual wealth and the size of bills. The Duke in\\nhis stately home will pay more than the dustman in his council flat. The\\nTreasury, which has always regarded property values as a reasonable proxy\\nfor income, is satisfied. So too are the politicians who can claim this\\nmakes the tax 'fair', or at least much fairer than the poll tax. All single\\nadults, including the famous little old lady, will get a 25 per cent\\ndiscount.\\nThe political compromise reveals itself in the decision to compress and then\\n'cap' the increases in bills which can be applied to the different bands.\\nThe government will set the bands nationally along with strict 'multipliers'\\nto regulate the proportion of revenue raised from properties in each\\ncategory.\\nMost importantly, the bill for a house worth, say, Pounds 1m or more in band\\n7 will not be more than 2.5 times higher than for the flat worth Pounds\\n40,000 in band 1. So the system will be progressive - about 90 per cent of\\nhouseholds will be unaffected by the 'cap' on band 7 - but, like the present\\nincome tax structure, only up to a point.\\nMr Heseltine hopes this compromise will calm Tory fears that a return to any\\nproperty tax would automatically create a swathe of 'losers' in the south.\\nThe Budget switch of more than Pounds 4bn of local taxation to VAT should\\nensure that average bills across the country should not be much more than\\nPounds 350 per household. The multipliers will prevent councils from loading\\nthe burden on to southern Tory voters who have benefited from the sharp rise\\nin property values over the past decade.\\nBills for similar properties will not be identical across the country. A\\nthree-bedroom semi in London will typically be in a higher band that a\\nsimilar house in Barnsley, so will attract a higher bill. The Treasury\\nthinks it should - incomes are higher in London than Barnsley. But the\\npoliticians will control the size of the differential.\\nIt all looks ingenious, and ministers are convinced that it will work. This\\ntime, they insist, the Treasury is fully behind the new system. It has been\\ntested on the computers in Great George Street as well as those in Marsham\\nStreet.\\nThere is even a fig-leaf for those still wedded to the principle that all\\nshould contribute to the cost of local services. Mr Heseltine will argue\\nthat the two-person household assumed by the tax will capture 38m of the 42m\\nadults theoretically liable to pay the poll.\\nThere is still, though, one serious weakness. Whatever the initial level of\\nbills, the commitment to the Uniform Business Rate means that any local tax\\nwill be highly 'geared'. A 10 per cent rise in spending beyond that allowed\\nfor in government grant would produce a 70 per cent rise in bills. More than\\none senior minister is convinced that the UBR cannot survive in its present\\nform. But talk of raising the tax burden on industry is for after, not\\nbefore, the general election.\",\n",

Sunday's crushing defeat for his Christian Democratic Union (CDU)\\nin the state of Rhineland-Palatinate leaves Mr Kohl's party in control in\\nonly one of the 10 west German states making up the old Federal Republic.\\nThe loss of the right's majority in the upper house of parliament, the\\nBundesrat (federal council), which has a veto over all tax legislation,\\nsignificantly constrains Mr Kohl's ability to govern. Less than five months\\nafter the Chancellor gained a sweeping victory in the December 2 all-German\\ngeneral elections, German politics is facing a confused period of\\nconfrontation, uncertainty and drift.\\nThe centre-right coalition in Bonn, made up of the CDU, the Bavarian\\nChristian Social Union (CSU), and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP),\\nstill has a secure majority in the lower house, the Bundestag. But Germany's\\nhighly developed system of political checks and balances now deprives Mr\\nKohl of the necessary means to push through unpopular decisions.\\nA large part of his misfortunes stems from his lack of foresight last year\\nin failing to present voters with a more accurate picture of the economic\\nand social challenges caused by German unification. Mr Hans-Werner Meyer,\\nthe head of Germany's Trade Union Federation (DGB), believes that, if Mr\\nKohl had announced the likelihood of tax rises before the December\\nelections, he would probably have won with a still higher majority.\\nAs it is, following the large rises in taxes and social security levies\\ndecided in February, the Chancellor is now paying a triple price for his\\nfoolishness. First, as was widely predicted at the end of his year of\\nvictory in 1990, his personal credibility has taken a nosedive.\\nSecond, the round of Social Democrat election successes in recent state\\npolls has resurrected regional coalitions between the SPD and the Greens in\\nLower Saxony, Hesse and now (probably) Rhineland-Palatinate. This has\\neffectively resurrected at a regional level the Greens party which is one of\\nMr Kohl's pet hates, and which appeared to be close to extinction after its\\ncollapse in the national December elections.\\nThird, Mr Kohl's misfortunes have prepared the way for a new spate of\\ncoalition bickering. The Chancellor's slightly bizarre revelation a\\nfortnight ago that Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the wheelchair-bound interior\\nminister, was the most likely man to succeed him has been roundly criticised\\nby Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and CSU chairman. Mr Waigel - who\\nshares the blame for last year's extraordinary economic policy insouciance -\\nbelieves that the premature start to a leadership debate has damaged the\\ncoalition's poll standing.\\nMr Waigel himself has done his bit towards incurring the wrath of the\\nfree-market wing of the FDP, by announcing at the end of last week his\\ndecision to water down plans for cuts in the next few years in taxes on\\ncompanies and high-earners. But these would anyway now have been blocked by\\nthe SPD majority in the Bundesrat - as well as by the need to trim the\\nswelling budget deficit.\\nIn view of decision-making disarray, and the sharp deterioration in\\nGermany's financial position, Mr Kohl's main hope is that an international\\neconomic recovery later this year come to Germany's rescue.\\nUnfortunately, the foreign exchange markets - where the D-Mark fell\\nyesterday to a 17-month low against the dollar - may upset the prospects.\\nWith the Bundesbank signalling its desire to press harder on the monetary\\nbrakes to bolster the D-Mark, Mr Kohl may face before too long, in addition\\nto the recession in east Germany, a sharp slowdown in growth in the\\npreviously booming west.\",\n",

Establishing a new legal framework to cover financial institutions,\\nmanufacturers in the free trade zone and a new international shipping\\nregister has taken up more time and encountered more bureaucratic obstacles\\nthan expected. Nevertheless, Madeira is slowly taking off as a viable\\nalternative or addition to existing offshore centres in Europe and\\nelsewhere.\\n'If you look at the early years of other centres, their own development was\\nnot any faster than ours. Early days are always difficult,' says Mr\\nFrancisco Costa, chairman of the Madeira Development Company (SDM), which is\\nresponsible for developing the island's offshore activities.\\nIn spite of initial problems, Madeira already has attracted a good number of\\nbusinesses including 13 banks, 231 service and trading companies, and 10\\nmanufacturing companies. Another five banks have applied to set up an\\noffshore branch, 10 more service companies have applied for a licence, and\\nthree more manufacturing companies are waiting for authorisation to operate\\nin the free trade zone. Response to the shipping register has been slower\\nwith only five vessels registered so far.\\nInitially, only branches of banks and investment companies could operate in\\nthe offshore centre. This was later extended to all financial institutions.\\nNow new laws are being prepared to allow funds to be domiciled locally and\\nto enable the local incorporation of full banks and insurance companies as\\nopposed to only branches. Mr Costa expects these to be in place this year.\\nThe shipping register has posed bigger problems. Until now, all crews for\\nPortuguese registered ships had to be 100 per cent Portuguese, a standard\\nrequirement in Portugal. This is in the process of being changed so that\\ncrews will only need to be 50 per cent from the European Community.\\nRestrictive and uncompetitive Portuguese mortgage regulations were another\\nproblem, and this is also being changed to allow ship-owners to choose the\\nlaw under which they will operate when registering a ship. New legislation\\nwill also allow private yachts to be registered.\\nMr Carlos Sousa, general manager of Steermar, a ship management services\\ncompany, says he expects to register 80-100 ships in the first year after\\nthe new law is approved. 'Foreign shippers are waiting for the change. We've\\nhad many enquiries, especially from Germany,' he says.\\nThe free trade zone has had more success with a mix of companies from as far\\napart as Brazil (plastics), Ireland (gold and jewellery), Lebanon (textiles\\nand marble), Liechtenstein (precision optical instruments), Hong Kong\\n(garments), and Portugal (construction materials, tobacco, electronics,\\nfood, and chemicals). Only a handful have started work, the others are\\nbuilding their own factories or in the process of installing machinery.\\nThe free zone is on a 120-hectare site on Madeira's eastern coast some 8km\\nfrom the airport and 30km from Funchal, the island's main town. Next to the\\nsmaller town of Canical, it is easily accessible though the roads and a\\ntunnel leading to the site are having to be widened and upgraded to cope\\nwith the heavier traffic. About half the initial 40 hectares to be prepared\\nin a first phase of development have been completed: the land levelled,\\nroads and infrastructures including water supplies and telecommunications\\ninstalled. Work on a new deep sea port directly serving the site began in\\nOctober 1990 and is due to be completed by the middle of next year. The\\nisland's main airport will be expanded to enable it to receive bigger\\naircraft and to improve freight facilities.\\nOfficials say rents are competitive at Dollars 13.50 per square metre of\\nland per year for a minimum of five years for companies building their own\\ninstallations, and Dollars 40 per square metre for ready-made building.\\nOffshore financial business is centred in Funchal. So far all but one of the\\nbank branches established are Portuguese. The exception is Lloyds Bank Fund\\nManagement of Guernsey, to be joined soon by Banque Franco Portugaise of\\nFrance. Mr Costa believes this is to be expected of the centre's\\ndevelopment. 'It is important to have Portuguese banks. It has a\\ndemonstration effect showing Portuguese banks are confident about the\\ncentre's prospects.'\\nThe banks do any type of business from taking deposits - there is strong\\ncompetition for remittances of emigrant Portuguese workers and the savings\\nof the wider Portuguese community around the world - to trade financing,\\nfund management and granting credit.\\nThere are considerable attractions for investors and companies. Incentives\\ninclude full tax holidays until 2011 for all financial institutions, trading\\nand manufacturing companies setting up offshore or in the free zone. This\\nallows banks, for example, to offer better conditions to their customers at\\nno extra costs.\\nForeign exchange rules have been liberalised. However, this has caused some\\nconcern to the financial authorities in Lisbon. Accordingly, the central\\nbank has asked for clarification on regulations covering the operations of\\nPortuguese non-banking institutions which it argues should be treated under\\nthe same tax regime as their mother companies and not as foreign companies.\\nThe central bank would like all non-financial Portuguese companies wishing\\nto operate offshore to first seek the bank's approval. 'There's a hole in\\nthe legislation on this,' a bank official says.\\nSeveral Portuguese or Madeiran companies, such as Companhia Insular de\\nMoinhos (CIM), a biscuit and pasta manufacturer, are moving into the free\\nzone to take advantage of the favourable tax regime. CIM is also using the\\nopportunity to restructure and modernise its production.\\nRequests for information have been 'pouring in', according to Mr Joao Luis\\nDias, director of Dixcart Management (Madeira), a subsidiary of the Dixcart\\ngroup.

       " 'FT911-3783': \"WHAT happens when a state-owned bank becomes private, and how does it\\nprepare for the change?\\nFor Mr Alipio Barrosa Pereira Dias, president of the Banco Totta & Acores\\n(BTA), the first Portuguese bank to be privatised, save for about 16 per\\ncent remaining in state hands, privatisation was a crucial factor for the\\nbank's future development not just because of the change in ownership, but\\nbecause it enabled the bank to do several things that it could not do\\nbefore.\\nThe privatisation itself took place in three separate stages: an initial\\nfloation on the stock exchange of 49 per cent of the bank's share capital in\\nJuly 1989, followed just over a year later with the sale of anothger 31 per\\ncent stake.\\nA capital increase last December, finally brought the private shareholding\\nin the bank to above 84 per cent.\\nDespite government limits on the purchase of privatised shares by\\nforeigners, Banesto, the Spanish banking group, managed to build up directly\\nand indirectly a controlling interest in the bank.\\nToday, Banesto holds directly around 10 per cent of the shares, while\\nValores Ibericos - a joint venture with a Portuguese partner in which it\\nholds 49 per cent, has another 28 per cent. Other shareholders are small and\\nin practice Banesto has effective control of the bank.\\nFrom the very begining, the privatisation had a dramatic impact on the bank.\\nFirst and foremost, it allowed it to strengthen its capital base and grow.\\nLike all Portuguese state-owned banks that were nationalised in 1975, BTA\\nhad seen its need for fresh capital frustrated by the unwillingness of\\nsuccessive governments to provide new funds.\\nA weak capital base was a common problem for the nationalised banks. It was\\na double handicap at a time when a system of credit ceilings - established\\nin the late 1970s and only recently abandoned - limited the amount a bank\\nwas allowed to lend on the basis of its capitalisation.\\nWith expansion thus constrained, BTA had to face increasingly tough\\ncompetition from new foreign and private Portuguese banks allowed to operate\\nonce more after an initial liberalisation of the banking system in 1984.\\nBy 1989, the need for fresh capital had become urgent if the bank was going\\nto remain competitive and grow. Privatisation came just at the right moment.\\n'It became possible to raise the bank's capital and with more capital we\\ncould expand our activities. This was the most important effect of\\nprivatisation,' Mr Dias says.\\nParadoxically, the credit ceilings now started to work in BTA's favour. The\\nstate-owned banks which were denied new injections of funds from the\\ngovernment could only strengthen their own capital base either by issuing\\nlimited amounts of participation certificates, or by ploughing back into the\\nbank what profits the state as main shareholder would decide to leave them.\\nThis clearly hampered their development, which was already more difficult\\nbecause of their heavy burden oif bad debts, inefficient structures and\\noverstaffing.\\nThe second most important effect was to give the bank a new sense of\\ndirection.\\nMr Dias who had joined BTA in 1988, prepared a new strategic plan for the\\nbank aimed at modernising operations, improving research and internal\\ncontrols, increasing the number of branches, and making more efficient use\\nof human resources.\\nStaff had to be reduced and productivity raised, older employees were\\nretired early or retrained.\\nWhereas in December 1987 the bank had on average 37 employees per branch,\\nthis is now down to 23 employees.\\nThe total number of employees has been reduced from about 4,500 in 1988 to\\n4,200 today in spite of an increase in the number of branches from 127 in\\nFebruary 1988 to 173 now.\\nMr Dias says he expects to open up another 10 to 15 branches by the end of\\nthis year. Productivity has risen dramatically, helped by the introduction\\nof new computing and software systems.\\nPrivatisation also meant changes in the image of the bank and in the\\nattitude of its employees.\\n'Sometimes it was simple things, like employees coming to work in casual\\nclothes without a tie. We had to explain to them this gave the bank a bad\\nimage. But you couldn't legislate this, you had to win their cooperation,'\\nhe says.\\nAnother problem was the length of the privatisation process. For a period of\\nmonths, the future of the bank and of its shareholding structure remained\\nuncertain. This made it especially important for the bank's management to\\nmaintain the full confidence of both the financial authorities and of its\\nstaff.\\n'It was crucial during the privatisation to make people understand the need\\nfor the process,' Mr Dias says.\\nConsultations and persuasion created a better climate than edicts from above\\nand sackings, though some lay-offs were inevitable.\\nBut over a year and a half after the initial part-privatisation, Mr Dias\\nfeels he has overcome the biggest obstacles - 'now we compete on equal terms\\nwith the private banks. By next year we'll be in a position to do much\\nmore.'\",\n",

       " 'FT911-3785': \"SINCE THE mid-eighties, the Portuguese stock market has been through an\\nexaggerated surge of business and endured a severe collapse. Only now, with\\na package of reforms due to be put in place this summer, are optimistic\\nobservers saying the market has calmed down after the excesses of the past\\nhalf-decade.\\nSix years ago, the market barely existed. There was a stock exchange, but\\nvolume was minuscule and there had not been a rights issue since before the\\n1974 revolution. All this changed in 1985-1986. The minority Social Democrat\\ngovernment stimulated business confidence. Portugal joined the European\\nCommunity. A bull market was born.\\n'The market took off in 1985-86 and carried on rising until October 1987,'\\nsays Joao Rendeiro, managing director of Gestifundo, a Lisbon-based\\nsecurities house. 'In the run-up to the election in June 87 there was\\nincredible euphoria. In other countries, the bull market took 10 years to\\nbuild up. Here the whole process was concertinaed into just six months.'\\nFrom 1983 to 1987, the number of quoted companies rose from 41 to 176; the\\nvalue of share transactions rose from Esc 5.7bn (Dollars 39m) to Esc\\n282.4bn. The total value of securities issued on the capital markets soared.\\nThe Banco Totta e Acores (BTA) index began 1987 at 1,220, rose to a peak of\\n6,812 just before the crash, but fell back to 2,990 by the end of the year.\\nIf it took a relatively short time for Portugal to enjoy a bull market, it\\nhas taken correspondingly longer for the market to revive after the crash.\\nThere have been two serious attempts at rallies, but the index ended last\\nyear at 2143.4, a fall of 34.6 per cent in local currency terms over 1990\\nand still well below its level at the end of 1987.\\n'After the crash Portuguese investors sold in panic like anywhere else,'\\nsays Mr Rendeiro, 'but all the weaknesses of a fragile infrastructure came\\nto the forefront dramatically. There was a huge shift in sentiment and for\\nmore than a year afterwards the market continued to sink downwards as\\ninvestors tried to come to grips with the mess left by October 1987.'\\nThe post-crash problems have been psychological and structural.\\nPsychological, because local investors had their fingers severely burned in\\nOctober 1987 and thereafter proved reluctant to get into the market.\\nStructural, because of an antiquated settlement system and a lack of\\nliquidity in the majority of stocks, which has discouraged all but the\\nbravest of foreign investors.\\nAlthough the number of companies quoted on the exchanges of Lisbon and\\nOporto rose from 135 to 182 between 1987 and 1990, the bulk of activity is\\nconcentrated on a dozen liquid stocks. Just 10 stocks - including Soporcel\\n(a pulp and paper company), Sonae (an industrial holdings company), Radio\\nMarconi Portuguesa (telecommunications), Banco Comercial Portugues, and\\nBanco Portugues de Investimento accounted for 52 per cent of the market's\\ncapitalisation at the end of 1990, while trading in these shares invariably\\naccounts for most of the average daily Dollars 5-Dollars 6m turnover.\\nIn January this year, the government finally approved a package of reforms\\nmeant to remedy some of the structural defects of the market. The main\\nfeatures are:\\nThe setting up of a Securities & Exchange Commission as the main regulatory\\nand supervisory body;\\nThe privatisation and unification of the markets in Lisbon and Oporto. The\\ntwo trading floors will remain but in future each will be managed by an\\nassociation of local brokers and dealers who will be responsible for setting\\nup an investors' compensation scheme;\\nThe creation of a central depository and settlement system;\\nThe implementation of a new paperless trading system, at first only for the\\nblue-chips, eventually for the market as a whole, giving investors\\ncontinuous stock prices; and rules and penalties on insider dealing,\\ntakeovers and mergers; share manipulation and disclosure rules.\\nThe package will be implemented in June at the earliest; preliminary reforms\\nwere introduced earlier this year (when the two exchanges introduced a\\nsecond daily price-fixing for the most liquid stocks) and at the beginning\\nof this month when a new partially computerised trading system was\\nintroduced in Lisbon.\\n'The initial impact of the stock market reform is difficult to assess,' says\\nMari Vargas, a London-based analyst at BNP Securities, 'but it should bring\\ngreater efficiency and liquidity to stock exchange transactions for the\\nbenefit of investors.\\n'Costs are also expected to go down . . . and the major foreign\\ninstitutional investors, including the Americans, that have been reluctant\\nto face the difficult trading conditions should reconsider their investment\\ndecisions.'\\nForeign investors, while accounting for much of the turnover, and owning 15\\nper cent of the market by market capitalisation (at the end of September\\n1990), were net sellers in the fourth quarter of 1990.\\nThe market's recovery in the first months of this year - up from 1986 at its\\nlowest point in mid-January to 2515 - is thought to be driven by domestic\\ninvestors awash with cash because of the delayed privatisation programme.\\nA revival of this programme in the months ahead will soak up that demand and\\nis likely to tempt back foreign investors who have traditionally been keen\\non new issues.\\nAs the early privatisations will be banks and insurance companies, the\\nmarket's heavy skewing towards financial services will be exacerbated: large\\nsectors of the economy such as property and tourism are under-represented,\\nwhile banks alone accounted for 39 per cent of the market's capitalisation\\nat the end of last year.\\nThe Portuguese market is the EC's smallest stock market and last year was\\nthe worst performer. But it gives investors the opportunity to invest in a\\nsmall but dynamic economy.\\nThus, if the market is still fragile, it certainly has potential - 'for the\\nfirst time in five years, stocks and p/e ratios are in line with\\ninternational standards,' says Mr Rendeiro.\\n'Prices react to events and information in a normal way. For the first time\\nwe begin to have a real market.'\",\n",

The only difference between the\\nPortuguese plant and Leica's two factories near Frankfurt is that labour\\ncosts are 65 per cent lower.\\n'We would not be in the market at all if it were not for our lower wage\\ncosts in Portugal,' says Mr Koch. Leica, now owned by Cambridge Instruments\\nof the UK and Switzerland's Wild group, set up a subsidiary in Portugal in\\n1973 when the pressure of Japanese competition forced the company to choose\\nbetween cutting costs or closing down.\\nThe Portuguese operation, Leica Aparelhos Optica de Precisao, has since\\nincreased its workforce more than twentyfold, investing a total of Es1.5bn\\n(Dollars 10.6m) over the past five years.\\nTwo new factory units were recently opened, raising the value of the\\ncompany's exports to Es3bn a year. Management is now considering negotiating\\na new investment contract with the Portuguese Institute of Foreign Trade\\n(ICEP).\\nLeica's success in Portugal bears out the assertion of Mr Antonio Neto da\\nSilva, the secretary of state for foreign trade, that, 'allied to efficient\\nmanagement and modern technology, Portuguese workers achieve productivity\\nand quality levels to equal the best in Europe'.\\nTwelve German technicians work at the Vila Nova de Familicao plant. But the\\nhead of the quality department is Portuguese.\\n'They like to say he is more German than the Germans,' says Mr Koch. Local\\nwomen, who make up 60 per cent of the workforce, show particular prowess at\\nclose precision work.\\n'The calibre of our workers; their willingness to learn skills and work hard\\nis one of the most satisfying aspects of being in Portugal,' says Mr Koch.\\nLow costs and high productivity such as those enjoyed by Leica are drawing\\nother foreign investors to Portugal in record numbers. Direct foreign\\ninvestment grew to Es509bn (Dollars 3.6bn) in 1990, a 46-per cent increase\\non the previous year - the increase in dollar terms was over 60 per cent.\\nMost investment originated from Britain, followed by France and Spain.\\nGerman investment, in fourth place, increased more than fourfold to Es60bn.\\nForeign companies already established in Portugal accounted for 56 per cent\\nof the total through capital increases and expansion projects.\\nHeavyweight projects such as the Es27.5bn investment by Continental of\\nGermany in a tyre manufacturing joint venture made the headlines. But only\\ntwo out of a total of 3,500 foreign investment projects went above Es10bn.\\n'It is the small and medium-sized foreign investments that are providing our\\nindustrial fabric with density and critical mass,' says Mr Miguel Athayde\\nMarques, vice-president of ICEP.\\nBesides illustrating the comparative advantages that are pulling foreign\\ninvestors to Portugal, the Leica subsidiary is also a prime example of why\\nthe government is so keen to attract them.\\nThe high-tech, high value-added plant is set in the Vale do Ave, the most\\ndepressed industrial region in the country, where the government estimates\\n45,000 jobs could be lost by 2000 as textile, clothing and footwear\\ncompanies - Portugal's principal sources of export revenue - fall victim to\\nincreased competition.\\n'Investment in new areas with a high technological component is vital for\\nthe structural adjustment of Portuguese industry and the efficient\\nreallocation of manpower and resources,' says Mr Athayde Marques.\\nThe sectors pinpointed by the government as having the most potential for\\ninvestment are information technology and electronics, biotechnology and\\npharmaceuticals, technical ceramics, special purpose plastics, medical\\nequipment, agribusiness, cars and components, equipment and machinery,\\nsporting goods and tourism.\\nForeign investment in such areas has been highly beneficial to the\\nPortuguese economy over the past six years. Exports are becoming\\nincreasingly less dependent on the labour-intensive, low value-added sectors\\nof clothing and shoes and moving into more technologically sophisticated\\nareas.\\nForeign manufacturers are forming upstream links with local suppliers. Their\\ndemanding requirements are helping to promote the upgrading of Portuguese\\ncompanies, forcing them to improve their performance in terms of\\nspecifications, quality, and delivery times.\\nThe benefits are also being felt in Portugal's backward agricultural sector\\nwhere productivity is less than a third of average EC levels. The Plein Sud\\ngroup of the French entrepreneur Mr Thierry Roussel recently launched the\\nfirst stage of a planned Dollars 100m investment in two large farms to\\nproduce off-season fruit and vegetables in the southern Alentejo, and plants\\nand flowers in northern Portugal. Both farms use modern production and\\nmanagement techniques that contrast dramatically with traditional methods.\\nThe Lisbon government's eagerness to capture foreign investment is backed by\\nattractive investment incentives for projects considered to have a positive\\nstructural impact. According to the Institute for the Support of Small and\\nMedium-sized Industries (IAPMEI), foreign investors account for 16 per cent\\nof the Es149bn that has been awarded in investment incentives since two\\nEC-funded grant schemes were launched at the beginning of 1989.\\nThat percentage is likely to undergo a substantial increase if a plan by\\nFord Europe and Volkwagen to invest more than Es300bn to manufacture a new\\nmultipurpose passenger vehicle in Portugal goes ahead. Officials are waiting\\nfor Brussels to approve finance for an incentive package reportedly worth\\nbetween Esc 100bn and Esc 130bn before finalising the project.\\nThe Portuguese Confederation of Industry complains this will be equal to the\\namount of incentives awarded to Portuguese companies over the past three\\nyears and has called for more support for local industry.\\nBut government officials say the amount of incentives for the\\nFord/Volkswagen plant has been exaggerated. They defend the project, which\\nwill be the largest single foreign investment ever made in Portugal, not\\nonly for the 5,300 jobs it will create directly but for the structural\\nimpact it will have on the economy as a whole, increasing the value of\\nexports with the planned production of 173,000 vehicles a year, promoting\\nthe growth of supply industries and indirectly creating thousands of other\\nnew jobs.\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSOURCES OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT (PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL FOREIGN INVESTMENT,\\n1980-89)\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nUK                       23.1\\nUS                       12.6\\nFrance                   11.4\\nSpain                    10.9\\nSweden                    6.1\\nNetherlands               5.6\\nEC                       64.5\\nEFTA                     10.5\\nJapan                     1.1\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSource: ICEP\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTOTAL DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN PORTUGAL (ES BN)\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1980                 6.2\\n1981                 9.2\\n1982                 9.7\\n1983                15.7\\n1984                27.6\\n1985                42.3\\n1986                24.5\\n1987                61.6\\n1988               138.0\\n1989               353.8\\n1990               509.0\\nTotal 1980-90    1,197.9\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSource: Portuguese Institute of Foreign Trade (ICEP)\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3787': \"SINCE 1984, Portugal's financial system has been through more change than\\nany other sector of the economy. New private banks and financial\\ninstitutions sprung up from nowhere to become leading players on the\\ndomestic market, offering new services, using more modern methods, and\\nbringing fresh ideas to shake the complacency of the state-owned and\\nstate-run banking establishment. Deregulation gradually helped open up\\nmarkets and the economy to international market forces.\\nLiberalisation was given a further push by European Community membership and\\nthe need to meet requirements for financial services and institutions. By\\n1992, Portugal will have to comply with the bulk of EC directives on the\\nliberalisation of the financial system except for short-term capital\\nmovements for which it has won a reprieve likely to last for another two to\\nthree years.\\nThe Banco de Portugal (central bank) which for years after the 1974\\nrevolution had been little more than a conveyor belt for Finance Ministry\\nedicts has not escaped the movement for reform, winning a new, more\\nindependent lease of life.\\nIt is now undergoing a programme of important changes that has already\\nstrengthened its independence and improved its operations. Mr Jose Alberto\\nTavares Moreira, the bank's governor, says that within three to four years\\nthe reform will be completed and the bank will have radically changed\\nstructures.\\n'At the end of that period we'll have a structure composed of six main\\ndepartments organised on the basis of the essential functions of the bank,\\ncompared with 19 departments when we started with the reform, and 12\\ndepartments now,' he says. The six departments will be responsible\\nseparately for economic research, the money markets, foreign exchange\\noperations, banking supervision, staff and administration, and issuing\\ncurrency. Each one will have its own director.\\nThe streamlining of functions will be accompanied with a streamlining of\\nstaff which will be reduced from about 3,000 at the start of the reform\\nalmost two years ago (now 2,300) to about 2,000 employees.\\nBut at least as important for the bank are the reforms outlined in a draft\\nlaw approved last autumn enhancing its autonomy. While Portugal's central\\nbank will not be as independent as Germany's Bundesbank, it will be more\\nindependent than the Bank of England or the Banque de France.\\nIn the past, the central bank was independent only in theory. It was\\ndescribed as the country's issuing bank, responsible for foreign exchange\\nregulations and currency management, as well as for the orientation and\\ncontrol of monetary policy, but with an important proviso: that it would\\ncarry out all these functions 'within the guidelines' established by the\\nFinance Ministry. And while it could give its opinion on monetary and fiscal\\npolicy, in practice the last word always belonged to the government. The\\nbank was essentially an administrative, and at times, political, instrument\\nof government.\\nIn what was a highly regulated financial environment the central bank acted\\nas a gendarme to ensure that the minutiae of economic and monetary policy\\ndictated by the Finance Ministry in great detail was properly enforced.\\nUnder its new statutes, it has won far greater freedom of action and is\\nrequired to fulfil its functions 'taking into account' government policies.\\nIt 'collaborates in defining' monetary and exchange rate policy and 'keeps a\\nwatch over the stability of the financial system'. It advises on monetary\\nand financial policy, and is responsible for supervising the monetary,\\nfinancial and foreign exchange markets.\\nIt is also no longer obliged, as in the past, to lend funds to the\\ngovernment. It was not uncommon for a government suddenly pressed for cash\\nto ask the bank for the money. This was a convenient way for governments to\\nhide part of their indebtedness and raise money cheaply since interest rates\\nwere set administratively. The bank could argue, but in practice it could\\nnot reject a government request for credit.\\nThe bank's management and the position of its governor have also been\\nstrengthened and given greater responsibilities. In the past the bank's only\\nauthority was its collective management board of which the governor was an\\nadministrative chairman, but under the new statutes the governor's role and\\nauthority have been enhanced.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3788': \"PORTUGAL is grossly under-insured by the standards of the European\\nCommunity.\\nAccording to a study conducted by Arthur Andersen, total premiums in 1989\\namounted to Es220bn (USDollars 1.5bn), which works out at about 3 per cent\\nof GDP - less than half the EC average. Premiums per head are around\\none-eighth of the level of the rest of Europe.\\nThe opportunities for such an underdeveloped sector are enormous, especially\\nin view of Portuguese people's high propensity to save. Recognising this,\\nthe number of insurance companies operating in Portugal has risen from 50 in\\n1986 to 65 now and an estimated 75 by the end of the year.\\nLike the banking sector, the insurance industry was owned and controlled by\\nthe state until the mid-1980s. The pace of change has been slower, though,\\nthan in banking and deregulation has in many cases brought pain rather than\\nprosperity.\\nThe market is extremely concentrated - the six biggest companies account for\\napproximately 70 per cent of the industry. In 1986, all were state-owned; by\\nnow one is totally private, another is in the throes of privatisation, and\\nthree more are to be sold off by the end of next year.\\nBetween 1984 and 1989, the state relinquished its control over tariffs in\\nsegment after segment of the insurance market. This ushered in an era of\\nfierce price competition, which according to Mr Ruy de Carvalho, president\\nof the Portuguese Insurers' Association, lingers on still.\\nThus, in sectors such as motor insurance, big-ticket industrial insurance\\nand workmen's compensation, premiums have fallen dramatically recently.\\n'After decades of control competition is now very lively,' Mr Carvalho\\nacknowledges.\\nIt is in the life sector that premiums rose most comfortably last year, by\\n26 per cent, twice the rate of inflation. It is the life business which\\noffers the biggest opportunity for profitable expansion. This accounts for\\nonly 20 per cent of the market against an average of 40 per cent across the\\nEC.\\nIn total, the life market grew from Es45.5bn to 69bn over 1989-90 and the\\nnon-life from 175.5bn to 221bn.\\nNew companies - such as Ocidental Seguros, the insurance subsidiary of the\\nBanco Comercial Portugues - have tended to concentrate on life. Older ones -\\nlike Fidelidade, Portugal's second largest insurer now owned by the giant\\nCaixa Geral - are scurrying to form distribution links with the banks. This\\nform of selling is gradually replacing the army of agents who act as\\nintermediaries.\\nMirroring the success of its parent company in the banking sector, Ocidental\\nhas come from nowhere to be the 14th largest insurance company. Seguros\\npredicts its premium income will grow by 80 per cent this year, an\\nindication of the vigour of the life business.\\nThe company would occupy a higher position still if motor insurance were\\nstripped out. This accounts for a substantial proportion of the premium\\nincome generated by the top six insurers but, according to Mr Joao Talone,\\npresident of Ocidental, losses in this segment of the market amounted to\\nEs7bn last year.\\nThe total profit across the sector was Es6 - 7bn last year. Talone says that\\ntwo thirds of this is not trading profit - 'the only thing the big companies\\ncan do is cut their rates to keep market share,' he comments. 'They have\\nmade most of their money by selling properties in the middle of a bull or by\\nselling shares bought long before the 1974 revolution.\\n'All the big insurers are engaged in window-dressing to make themselves look\\ngood for privatisation,' he says.\\n'The state sector companies are hampered from doing deals with banks to\\nsecure distribution channel for life products,' he continues. 'Nobody knows\\nwho's going to end-up owning whom. We are selling well into our own bank\\nbecause we are part of the same culture. They have been forced to compete\\nvery strongly without having the tools to take the necessary strategic\\ndecisions.'\\nMr Jose Antonio Santos Texeira, president of Imperio, the largest insurance\\ncompany in Portugal and yet to be privatised, rejects any suggestion that\\nthe state sector is grossly inefficient.\\nHe admits, however, that the company is handicapped by its public-sector\\nstatus.\\nMr Texeira would like to have a bank and a large foreign insurance company\\nas shareholders. Rivals comment that the problem with the privatisation\\nprogramme is that the state will demand a high price for its insurance\\nassets, but will want control to remain in the hands of the Portuguese. The\\ntrouble may be that only outsiders will be willing to pay the price.\\nForeign interest in the sector is high: Andersen calculated that Portuguese\\ncompanies will have less than 60 per cent of the market by 1995. The main\\nforeign entrants are from France and Spain, and they have considerably\\ngreater financial muscle. Ruefully, Mr Texeira says that his company's\\ncapital amounts to Pounds 2.5m, compared to the Pounds 1bn of UAP, the\\nFrench group which has acquired Garantia, Portugal's seventh largest\\ninsurance company, and which is poised to take control of Alianca, another\\nstate-owned insurer - when its privatisation is finally completed.\",\n",

Only inflation, at 13.4 per cent for the year, appeared to cloud\\nthe horizon.\\nYet, in spite of the good news which merited praise from the Organisation\\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European\\nCommission, there remain serious underlying problems of which inflation -\\nwhich officials seem at times to perceive as only a temporary difficulty\\ncaused by too much success - is just one.\\nTrue, exports are rising, but not as much and not sufficiently fast to\\novercome an enduring trade deficit. Merchandise imports have grown much\\nfaster than exports. The value of imports of goods rose by 31.5 per cent\\nfrom Dollars 17.6bn in 1989 to Dollars 23bn last year, while the value of\\nexports of goods grew by a sturdy but more modest 25.2 per cent from Dollars\\n12.7bn in 1989 to Dollars 16.4bn. The deficit in traded goods rose by almost\\n35 per cent in 1990, resuming an upward trend that had been reversed in\\n1989.\\nIt will not be easy to overcome this imbalance, although some important\\nmanufacturing projects now under way will help in the future. But for the\\ntime being, Portuguese manufactured goods tend, with few exceptions, to be\\nof lower quality and geared to the mass market. Inefficient production\\nmethods are compensated for by the lowest labour costs in the Community,\\nPortugal\\'s largest market. But that comparative advantage is being\\nincreasingly eroded as competition from other EC and non-EC producers\\nbecomes more intense, and as wages rise to come more into line with those in\\nthe rest of Europe.\\nMr Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, governor of the Banco de Portugal (central\\nbank), argues that the growth in exports demonstrates that Portuguese\\nindustry is becoming more competitive: \\'In spite of the strong appreciation\\nof the escudo we have managed to have a current account practically in\\nsurplus. This shows that there has been a considerable restructuring of the\\neconomy. There have been extensive productivity gains.\"\\nThat is true in some industries though the extent and significance of the\\nrestructuring is less certain. Traditional sectors such as textiles or\\nagriculture - the two biggest areas of activity - are deeply in crisis.\\nRepeated complaints about high interest rates - at between 21 per cent and\\n23 per cent for prime corporate clients for a year, or 24 per cent to 26 per\\ncent for small companies - and recurrent calls for help from Portuguese\\nbusiness groups in the face of foreign competition suggest that industry\\nremains deeply apprehensive about the future.\\nThe current account has improved with the latest figures for 1989 showing a\\nsurplus of Dollars 139m instead of the forecast deficit of Dollars 550m, and\\ninitial - likely to be revised - figures for 1990 showing a deficit of\\nDollars 61m compared to a forecast deficit of Dollars 1.2bn. But this was\\nachieved not simply because exports grew - though that helped - but in large\\npart because of higher than expected earnings from tourism, up by almost 30\\nper cent from Dollars 2.1bn in 1989 to Dollars 2.7bn last year, and higher\\nemigrants remittances worth Dollars 4.2bn.\\nFor Portugal to be able to benefit fully from European integration and\\nEuropean economic and monetary union (EMU) inflation must be brought under\\ncontrol and the inflation differential between Portugal and its European\\npartners reduced. But while inflation was brought down from its 1984 peak of\\nnearly 30 per cent to an annual rate of 9.4 per cent in 1987, it has edged\\nback up since then.\\nMr Miguel Beleza, the finance minister, appointed more than a year ago, is\\nmore cautious than his predecessor when it comes to forecasts, but his own\\n10.5 per cent target, later revised to 11 per cent, still fell short of the\\n13.4 per cent annualised average rate actually achieved - more than double\\nthe European average.\\nThis year, the government hopes to bring down inflation to a maximum 11 per\\ncent. Mr Tavares Moreira says this is feasible though it will be difficult\\nbecause of strong demand pressure. \\'It is not easy to deflate an economy\\nunder these conditions,\\' he says.\\nThere are signs that price rises may have slowed a little with the\\nannualised average rate in February falling 0.1 of a percentage point to\\n13.3 per cent, but this is still a long way from the 8 per cent which he\\nsays would be desirable to bring the escudo into the Exchange Rate Mechanism\\n(ERM) of the European Monetary System (EMS), a move the government would\\nlike to make as soon as possible.\\nAnother factor may now also be entering the inflation equation. In recent\\nyears, wages have lagged behind rather than led inflation, but this could be\\nchanging. An agreement last autumn between the government and some of the\\nunions to keep wage increases to 13.5 per cent may limit rises in the state\\nsector, but low unemployment and labour scarcity, especially in parts of the\\nprivate sector, is causing strong upward pressure with pay deals this year\\nreaching 16 per cent. Yet wages must go up if higher productivity gains are\\nto be achieved.\\nThe government is caught between conflicting pressures. In the past,\\ninterest rates were kept high administratively as part of efforts to curb\\ncredit demand and consumption to fight inflation. Now, with moves towards\\nmarket set rates, the main and enduring cause of high interest rates remains\\nthe budget deficit which represents between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent of\\nGDP. Government borrowing effectively sets the rates for the market.\\nPrivatisations which last year brought the government an extra income of\\nnearly Dollars 1bn, cannot help since revenue from the sale of state-owned\\nassets cannot be used to finance the budget. Meanwhile, high interest rates\\nand a stable currency encourage capital inflows thereby adding to\\ninflationary pressures.\\nMoreover, as the economy is opened up and the financial system is\\nliberalised it is increasingly difficult for the authorities to control\\ncapital movements. Short-term capital inflows proved especially troublesome\\nlast year having increased from Dollars 770m in 1989 to Dollars 1.8bn which\\nrepresented more than one third of all capital movements in 1990. To\\ndiscourage these mainly speculative capital movements the authorities\\ntightened up foreign exchange rules and allowed greater fluctuations in the\\nvalue of the escudo by ending the practice of maintaining a \\'crawling peg\\'\\naccording to which the escudo was depreciated by 0.25 per cent a month. The\\nimmediate effect, however, was to send the escudo up rather than down.\\nSo those hoping for a depreciation of the escudo are unlikely to see their\\nwishes satisfied. \\'We have to see the exchange rate level on a long-term\\nbasis, and (on that basis) the escudo is about right at the moment,\\' Mr\\nTavares Moreira says, adding, \\'there is no alternative to maintaining a very\\nfirm monetary policy\\'. And that means the squeeze between high real interest\\nand exchange rates is likely to continue.\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCAPITAL MOVEMENTS NOT RELATED TO FOREIGN DEBT (DOLLARS M)\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                1987       1988       1989       1990\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMedium and long-term capital     758        938       2217       3226\\nForeign                          768       1162       2505       3550\\nDomestic                         -10       -224       -288       -324\\nShort-term capital*              628       1653        770       1863\\nTOTAL                           1386       2591       2987       5089\\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n*Any bank transaction of up to one year; note - values for 1990 may be\\nrevised.

       " 'FT911-3791': \"SOMETIME soon the distinctive rich, blue colours of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya\\n(BBV), Spain's biggest banking group, will be hoisted on to the front of the\\nmodern headquarters of Lloyds Bank Portugal on Lisbon's busy Avenida da\\nLiberdade.\\nThe occasion will mark the end of an era for the British bank which put down\\nits first roots in Portugal in 1865 as the Anglo Portuguese Bank, later\\ntransformed into the Bank of London and South America, and which has\\noperated under its present name since the 1970s.\\nOne of the few banks to escape the 1975 revolution's sweeping\\nnationalisations, Lloyds kept and developed a small but highly profitable\\nbusiness niche in the country.\\nWhen the bank's sale to BBV for Pounds 110m is approved by the Portuguese\\nauthorities, it will also highlight the recent inroads made by Spanish banks\\ninto the Portuguese market. It is not quite a flood, but it is already a\\ngood deal more than a trickle.\\nApart from BBV, Banesto has bought a leading stake in Banco Totta & Acores\\n(BTA), Banco Santander has a substantial share of Banco de Comercio e\\nIndustria (BCI), and Banco Exterior de Espana has a main branch in Lisbon\\nand plans to open several more branches this year.\\nFurthermore, Banco Hispano Americano is waiting for authorisation to\\ntransform its Portuguese investment company into a bank, Banco Central has a\\nrepresentative office and a standing request for a branch and several\\nregional savings banks have representations in Portugal.\\nAll this, of course, excludes specialised investment, leasing and real\\nestate companies.\\nBut whereas most Spanish banks chose either to build up their stakes\\ngradually in local institutions as Banesto has done through BTA's\\nprivatisation or start from scratch with an investment or fund management\\ncompany, BBV has taken a different route by buying up an existing private\\nbank with a small but well-established network of a dozen branches.\\nIt was an unexpected move, but one which fitted the Spanish group's\\nstrategy. Mr Gonzalo Terreros, BBV international manager, says the bank\\nwanted to be in the Portuguese market to offer universal banking services\\nwith an emphasis on corporate and private banking.\\nHe sees Portugal as a rapidly expanding market with reactions similar to the\\nSpanish market in the early 1980s.\\n'Spain and Portugal are the fastest growing areas in Europe,' he says.\\nLloyds was chosen after a study of various other possibilities including\\nthat of buying a bank that was being privatised. This was discarded as too\\nslow, too uncertain, and as a potential source of conflict with the\\nPortuguese authorities.\\nBBV wanted to avoid the controversy that surrounded Banesto's move into BTA\\nas well as the need to have to negotiate with too many diversified\\nshareholders.\\nAt the same time it was not seeking a commercial bank with a large branch\\nnetwork. For size and nature of its business Lloyds fitted BBV's ambitions.\\nCalculating that Lloyds which had been cutting back on its international\\noperations may be willing to sell, BBV approached the bank and was able to\\nclinch a deal within a relatively short time.\\n'We were sure that the bank would be healthy, productive and without bad\\nsurprises. So the Lloyds trademark was a guarantee,' Mr Terreros said.\\nAnother of the bank's assets with BBV was that although Lloyds was not a\\ntypical retail bank, it had a network of branches and operated in all BBV's\\ntarget markets: wholesale and retail banking with a good corporate customer\\nbase in the state and private sectors, among medium and small companies, and\\nwith a solid private clientele of high net worth individuals.\\nSince 1986, Lloyds has more than doubled its total assets which where valued\\nat Es87.3bn at the end of last year with profits of Es1.2bn.\\nOnce it is authorised to transform the bank into a 100 per cent BBV-owned\\nPortuguese subsidiary it intends to build on the bank's present strengths\\nand seek to capture a greater chunk of the market among small and\\nmedium-size companies and among private customers.\\n'We think we will be able to develop immediately new products, new customers\\nand markets, and compete with highly attractive products in those parts of\\nthe market that are growing very fast,' Mr Terreros says.\\nPlans are to increase the number of branches to around 35 within 18 months.\\nIn the longer-term, the goal is to establish BBV as an important Portuguese\\nbank with 'a Portuguese team and character, not a marginal foreign bank'.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3792': \"IN THE past five years the Portuguese banking sector has risen swiftly from\\na very low base. The question troubling bankers now is whether the growth\\ncan continue in the years to come.\\n'There have been five terrific years of banking,' reflects Mr Carlos\\nRodrigues, president of Manufacturers Hanover (Portugal). Margins have been\\nhigh, competition from the state-owned banks - which even after the latest\\nprivatisations account for 75 per cent of the sector - less than vigorous.\\nUp until earlier this year, the financial authorities maintained a strict\\ncredit ceiling on bank lending. According to Mr Timothy Bradbury, managing\\ndirector of Lloyds Bank, Portugal (recently bought by BBV, Spain's largest\\nbank), this meant that corporate customers 'were competing to borrow. In the\\nmeantime, the private banks could buy liquidity from the public banks and\\nlend it out under their own credit ceiling.'\\nEven now, savers are paid 14-15 per cent on their deposits, subject to 20\\nper cent withholding tax, which works out at less than inflation. Banks then\\nlend out the funds at 26 per cent retail and 22 per cent wholesale. With\\nsuch handsome margins, it is not surprising that the banks have prospered.\\nThe growth of the sector as a whole is captured in the extraordinary story\\nof Banco Comercial Portugues. When the bank started in 1986, it had 205\\nshareholders, capital of Esc 3.5bn and 255 employees. Now it has nearly\\n25,000 shareholders, capital of Esc 66bn and it employs 2,500 people.\\nThere is more turnover in BCP shares on the Lisbon stock exchange than in\\nany other company's shares. Coming from nowhere five years ago, BCP is now\\none of Europe's top 100 banks in terms of capital strength and one of the 60\\nlargest in terms of market capitalisation.\\nThe banking industry today cannot be understood without remembering that in\\n1975 all Portuguese banks were nationalised. It was not until ten years\\nlater that the government promoted legislation allowing private banks to be\\nset up. The first stage of deregulation drew six foreign banks into Portugal\\nwithin 18 months, and local entrepreneurs founded four banks, of which BCP\\nis the best-known.\\nThis sudden influx of competition had a profound effect on the sleepy public\\nsector banks. They were exposed as not merely grossly inefficient by\\nEuropean standards - they had more employees per branch than any other\\nEuropean country and fell behind by all other yardsticks  - but downright\\ninsolvent.\\n'Throughout the 1970s and early '80s, we had a social role and we were not\\ndriven by normal financial and economic goals,' reflects Mr Pedro Rebelo de\\nSousa, president of the Banco Fonsecas & Burnay, a state-owned bank which is\\nhoping to be privatised later this year. By the mid-1980s, the consequences\\nof this uncommercial approach were clear: the average percentage of bad\\ncredit to total loan portfolios among the state-owned banks had climbed to\\n20 per cent.\\n'Many of the borrowers simply didn't exist,' quips one banker. Add-in\\nunfunded pension liabilities and dubious accounting policies and the result\\nwas most of the state-owned banks were insolvent.\\nThe reaction of Fonsecas to the new environment is typical of that of the\\nwhole state-owned sector. It shrunk its staff by 25 per cent. It shored up\\nits balance sheet by selling off properties amid a bull market for real\\nestate. It sorted out its provisions for bad debts and unfunded pension\\nliabilities. It has invested heavily in information technology.\\nFonsecas now considers that it is virtually indistinguishable from\\nPortugal's private-sector banks. a feeling shared by the large state sector\\nbanks such as Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa, which is also\\nhoping to be privatised later this year. The tidying up process completed,\\nthese banks like to think of the state as just another shareholder.\\nIn this vein, Mr Alipio Dias, president of the Banco Totta & Acores, in\\nwhich the government retains a residual 15 per cent holding, says 'the\\ntreasury is a shareholder like any other.' According to Mr Alexandre Vaz\\nPinto, president of the Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa and the\\nchairman of the Portuguese Bankers' Association, the average percentage of\\nbad debts to loan portfolio is down to 14 per cent across the state-owned\\nsector.\\nMore recently, the public and partially-public banks have shared in the\\ngeneral prosperity of the sector. For example, the 85 per cent privatised\\nBanco Totta reported a 76 per cent increase in cash flow last and assets\\nwere up 33 per cent, with profits rising from Esc 73m in 1985 to 3.26bn in\\n1989. This year the rise in cash flows will be less, but lower provisions\\nwill mean that net profits rise by as much as 50 per cent.\\nThe pattern is repeated at Caixa Geral de Depositos, the gargantuan\\nstate-sector bank which on its own has 25-30 per cent of the Portuguese\\nbanking market, a fact easy to understand when one considers that it has\\n8.5m customers out of a population of 10.5bn. Here, profits have risen from\\nEsc 8.9bn in 1984 to Esc 29.9bn in 1989, with cash flows rising from Esc\\n15.5bn to Esc 82.2bn.\\nCaixa, which will never leave the public sector, is planning an aggressive\\nbranch-opening programme, and aims to increase its branches from 420 to 500\\nby the end of next year. Caixa is not alone in expanding its branch network\\n -all the other banks are doing it too. This is but one symptom of\\nincreasing competition in the banking sector.\\nThe government has yet to deregulate its rules forbidding banks to offer\\ninterest-bearing current accounts at anything paying anything other than\\nnominal rates. But relaxation of this rule is expected sooner or later.\\nAnother factor behind the increasing competition is the presence of foreign\\nbanks - in particular Spanish banks eager to repeat in Portugal the success\\nthey have had on domestic territory. More significant, though, is the recent\\nabolition of the credit ceiling. This frees the banks' lending capacity.\\nCombined with increased competition in the market for retail deposits, it is\\ninevitable that banks' spreads and profit margins will narrow.\\n'When we were founded we realised we only had a limited time to reach a\\ncertain dimension,' reflects Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, President of BCP.\\n'In 1985, we calculated that we wouldn't face intense competition for 5-7\\nyears and that we could reach a certain market share by launching innovative\\nproducts and introducing new technology. We were were always clear that in\\n1992 and afterwards there would be intense competition from foreign and\\ndomestic private banks.'\\nCompetition from foreign banks will be restrained for as long as the\\ngovernment keep in place its restrictions on short term capital flows.\\nLooking ahead, one banker reflects that the days of easy money are over  -\\n'it's going to be war out there,' he said, 'and it's going to be bloody.'\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3793': \"Lisbon waterfront, the Finance Ministry, Stock Exchange and several\\ngovernment departments are located in this area of the city. Lisbon is also\\nPortugal's chief port and lies on the right bamk of the Tagua River, 13 kms\\nfrom the river's entry into the Atlantic Ocean, at the westernmost fringe of\\nthe European continent. Portugal's main towns and cities include Oporto,\\nSetubal, Colombra and Brage. Pictured below, Lisbon's main square, the Praca\\ndo Comercio.\\nTHIS YEAR is likely to go by unusually quickly for Portugal. First, it is\\nhaving to speed up the pace of reform to meet next year's European Community\\ndeadlines for the internal market. It must prepare also for its first EC\\npresidency starting on January 1 - exactly six years after it joined the\\nCommunity.\\nBefore that, a general election, due by October at the latest, will decide\\nwhether Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister and leader of the ruling\\nSocial Democratic party, remains in power for a third term of government.\\nAt stake will be a particular model and style of government whose\\nachievements and shortcomings are likely to come under close scrutiny in the\\nrun-up to the election.\\nThe result of the vote cannot be forecast, but the tenant at the Sao Bento\\nprime ministerial residence will have his work cut out. Economic pressures\\nare building up in spite of some striking successes.\\nIn the years that followed its accession to the Community, Portugal\\nbenefited from propitious domestic circumstances, a favourable international\\nenvironment and considerable goodwill and assistance to help it modernise\\nand catch up with its European partners.\\nBut it is still a relatively poor country, and after five years of rapid\\ngrowth and development, new problems have emerged and some old ones are\\nre-asserting themselves with a vengeance.\\nThe good news is that Portugal continued to grow at a faster rate than any\\nof its European partners last year with the gross domestic product rising by\\n4.4 per cent. Investment, up by more than 8 per cent, remained sturdy, and\\nforeign investment rising by over 60 per cent was buoyant. Official\\nunemployment was negligible and industrial activity high. The current\\naccount was almost balanced.\\nThe bad news is that inflation at 13.4 per cent - more than twice the EC\\naverage - resisted official efforts to bring it down.\\nThe budget deficit at close to 7 per cent of GDP is proving equally\\ndifficult to reduce, and it is keeping interest rates at punishingly high\\nlevels squeezing industry. Traditional sectors from agriculture to textiles\\nare inefficient and facing their most serious crisis yet.\\nIn the past few years, the government has carried out or began several\\nimportant reforms. A land reform has opened the way for privatising the\\nlarge collective farms, the gradual privatisation of companies nationalised\\nin 1975 and 1976 has started to reduce the weight of the public sector in\\nthe economy, new labour laws have relaxed some of the rigidities of the\\nlabour market and eased conditions for dismissals, a tax reform has made tax\\ncollection more efficient, and the financial sector has seen the most\\nextensive liberalisation and deregulation of all, spurred along by the need\\nto meet the approaching 1992 deadline for an EC-wide internal market in\\nfinancial services. But there is still much to be done.\\nMr Rui Machete, past minister in several governments, former president of\\nthe Social Democratic party and the chairman of the parliament's budget,\\nfinance and planning committee, identifies four areas in need of fundamental\\nstructural change: agriculture, industry, social welfare and education.\\nPortuguese agriculture employs about 19 per cent of the active population\\nbut accounts for only six per cent of gross domestic product. Fewer than 15\\nyears ago, Portugal's population was predominantly rural, yet it cannot feed\\nitself and depends for more than half of its food on imports.\\nPart of the problem is due to an excessive division of the land into a\\nplethora of tiny unviable plots, mainly in the north, and inefficient huge\\nco-operative farms created after the revolution, mainly in the south.\\nProductivity is among the lowest in the EC and most farmers survive thanks\\nto generous subsidies. Mr Machete says the land structure and the system of\\nagricultural price subsidies will have to change, though he expects it will\\ntake several years of transition.\\nIndustry also faces the challenge of the internal market. Most Portuguese\\ncompanies remain unprepared for the inevitable increase in competition after\\n1992, and continue to rely on old production methods, low wages, and\\noutdated management methods. There are exceptions, and larger companies,\\nmany of them foreign or with international links or partners, find they can\\nachieve productivity levels comparable to those in other European countries.\\nIn contrast to the growing apprehension of some Portuguese business groups,\\nforeign investors exude optimism, seeing in Portugal's relative backwardness\\nthe springboard for sustained and dynamic development.\\nIn the long run, foreign investment can have a ripple effect throughout the\\neconomy, encouraging the development of local suppliers and helping to raise\\nquality standards, but the adaptation will be difficult. A large number of\\nsmall and medium-size companies will face a straightforward choice:\\nmodernise or close - many will probably have to close. Industrial\\nrestructuring will inevitably lead to job losses which will have to be\\nalleviated through a more efficient and expanded social security system\\nsince it will not be possible to retrain all displaced workers.\\nEducation is in a sorry state. Teachers are underpaid, career conditions\\nunattractive and schools and colleges plagued with recurring strikes.\\nIlliteracy at anything between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the\\npopulation, depending on the statistics, is still widespread and educational\\nstandards are generally low. As old industries give way to new ones or\\nmodernise, training and retraining have become more important. The EC is\\nhelping through its social fund to finance training in private industry. But\\nas Portugal prepares for the future, education will need greater resources\\nwith more emphasis placed on quality.\\nReducing the weight of the state in the economy is another huge task. In\\neconomic terms, the state accounts for nearly 40 per cent of GDP, but its\\nweight in particular sectors is overwhelming. In the financial sector, it\\nstill controls about 80 per cent of the market. Once the privatisation\\nprogramme is completed, the two big financial groups remaining in state\\nhands together will have between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the market.\\nPrivatisations are a key element in the government's strategy to reduce the\\nweight of the state and open the economy to market forces, but the process\\nhas been slow and prone to delays.\\nConditions are less favourable now than they were 18 months or a year ago,\\ninvestors have become more wary especially since share prices of privatised\\ncompanies have tended to fall below their original, often high, selling\\nprice. This may not matter too much for big domestic or foreign groups whose\\nobjective is to win market positions, but it has shaken the confidence of\\nsmaller investors.\\nDiminishing the size of the state is only part of a wider need to reduce\\nbureaucracy and bureaucratic interference.\\n'There is an enormous bureaucracy run by incompetent people who interfere in\\ntoo many areas and in excessive detail,' says a senior businessman airing a\\ncommon complaint.

The group had also\\nsuffered a rise in bad debts.\\nHe said 'as a result the group's results in the current year will fall short\\nof those for which we had hoped at the time of my interim statement'.\\nAnother reason for the recommendation was that the UK mail order industry\\nwas being shaken up following the sale of Grattan to Otto Versand, the\\nGerman retailer, and the possible sale by Littlewoods of its mail order\\nside. This was likely to make the market more competitive. Also the\\nperformance of Empire's shares, if it remained independent, was likely to be\\naffected by Redoute's holding.\\nThe recommendation to shareholders also said they should accept 'unless a\\nhigher offer is announced'.

It needs to be; last year, gas prices went up twice -\\nby 7.5 per cent in March and by between 3.3 and 3.7 per cent in November.\\nThese increases were justified under the current formula, which links the\\nprice of gas to the retail price index, minus 'x', plus 'y', where 'x' is a\\n2 per cent efficiency factor and 'y' is the cost to British Gas itself of\\nobtaining raw fuel.\\nIt is to be hoped that Ofgas, with the help of two external accountants, is\\ntaking a robustly sceptical view of both the 'x' and 'y' factors. Although\\nthe British Gas publicity machine has been active in recent months in\\npresenting the results of its own customer surveys, there remains a\\nsuspicion that this private sector near-monopoly still needs to shed more\\nthan a few pounds in weight. It has not, to take just one example, been\\ndriving particularly hard bargains on the pay front.\\nSearching inquiry\\nAs for the cost of British Gas's raw materials, there are also good grounds\\nfor searching inquiry. The company's dominance of the retail market does not\\nnecessarily give it the strongest possible incentive to obtain the lowest\\ncost supplies and there is, at the very least, room to question British\\nGas's efficiency as an operator of its own gas fields. At the point of\\nprivatisation, it was impossible for any outsider to unscramble British\\nGas's accounts to make a fair judgment on these points. Ofgas will have let\\ndown gas customers very badly if it has failed to sort out the figures.\\nOfgas has also served notice that it intends to reconsider the appropriate\\nreturn for British Gas, the value of its assets and new ways in which it can\\nbe held accountable for standards of service.\\nThe next stage of this lengthy process, due in the next week, is that\\nBritish Gas has to inform Ofgas whether it accepts the regulator's proposed\\npricing formula. If it does not, the matter is automatically referred to the\\nMonopolies and Mergers Commission for detailed examination.\\nMMC involvement\\nThere is a very strong case for MMC involvement, not least because it would\\nexpose to public scrutiny the detail of Ofgas's case and British Gas's\\nresponse. One of the biggest problems caused by the misjudged privatisation\\nof British Gas, which was allowed to keep most of its monopoly power, is\\nthat the kind of public disclosure which was to some extent required of a\\nnationalised industry can now be resisted on grounds of commercial\\nconfidentiality.\\nAs the rules stand, however, British Gas can avoid a bruising run-in with\\nthe MMC simply by agreeing to the Ofgas plan. It is to be hoped, in that\\nevent, that one element in the Ofgas proposal is that there should be full\\npublic exposure of its analysis. There is no point in Ofgas setting itself\\nup as a policeman of the meter man's punctuality if its essential\\ncalculations about prices are lost in obscurity.\\nNor should the politicians who designed the regulatory regime in gas make\\nthe mistake of thinking that these are matters of little interest to voters.\\nEnergy prices are uncontroversial so long as they are relatively stable. But\\nthe new gas price formula will cover the period from 1992 to 1997. It will\\nonly take a modest oil and gas price shock in that period to turn the arcane\\nalgebra of Ofgas into front page news.\\nRegulating a company as powerful as British Gas is not easy, and so far\\nOfgas has had only modest success in stimulating competition in the\\nindustrial gas market. For domestic customers, Ofgas looks like remaining\\nthe only protection against the abuse of monopoly power. That is why its\\nnext move on prices needs to be rigorous and visibly so.\",\n",

The city's two main music institutions - the\\nSemper Opera and the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra  - will survive, but\\nmuch of the cultural substructure will not. The first night of Osud was less\\nthan three-quarters full. That says less about the Dresdeners' lack of\\ncuriosity (or about ticket prices, which are still extremely low), than that\\nthey have other preoccupations in these hard times.\\nOsud marks the end of an era: it is Joachim Herz's last production in\\nDresden. He has worked there in comparative obscurity for the past ten\\nyears, but his production style and cantankerous personality have made him\\nsuperfluous to the incoming artistic team led by Christoph Albrecht. Herz's\\ndecision to take the Saxon state government to court over the ending of his\\ncontract makes a sad spectacle.\\nOsud illustrated two classic traits in postwar German opera production - a\\nnatural animation of the stage, releasing the inner impetus of the music,\\nwhich is Herz's inheritance from Walter Felsenstein; and a congenital\\ntendency to over-interpret. Act one was beautiful. Reinhart Zimmermann's\\npermanent set consisted of a gently stepped wooden platform, which together\\nwith Eleonore Kleiber's costumes preserved the period charm of Janacek's\\nsetting. Behind lay a wall of large slanted mirrors, reflecting the stations\\nin Zivny's relationship with Mila - the first rapture of eyes meeting, the\\nexchange of roses after one of Zivny's concerts. But the chief distinction\\nlay in Herz's choreography of the spa scenes - the sedate bourgeoisie, the\\ncarefree couples, the brood of schoolgirls - so that everyone on stage was\\nan individual, without a trace of the artificial movement that has become\\nsynonymous with Herz's successors at the Komische Oper.\\nThe domestic setting of Act two was suggested by little more than a settee,\\na kitchen dresser and a precipitous flight of stairs. Here Herz depicted the\\ninterlocking pressures on Zivny - mother-in-law, creative crisis, marriage\\nstrains, alcohol problem - through a series of equally convincing vignettes.\\nHaving respected Janacek's awkward but viable dramatic outline thus far,\\nHerz then made a complete mess of the final act. Zivny's tortured solos were\\ntransposed to the beginning, as he wrestled with skeletons of the past\\n(bombed-out buildings, machine-gunfire and the usual German militaristic\\ncliches) in an attempt to reactivate his creative inspiration. After a\\nshortened conservatoire scene, with Mila reincarnated as the impressionable\\nstudent Souckova, Zivny ended up in a mental clinic. For anyone who saw the\\nENO and Dusseldorf stagings in the mid-1980s, both of which were faithful to\\nJanacek's original, Herz's solution was nothing more than a piece of\\ninterpretative hack-work.\\nNo such reservations about the musical performance, which was consistently\\ninspired. The rhythmic buoyancy and clean, light-fingered articulation of\\nthe orchestral playing under Hans Zimmer showed that the Staatskapelle can\\nbe as idiomatic in Janacek as they are in Richard Strauss. Zivny was sung by\\nMichael Rabsilber, whose pointed Germanic high tenor and sensitive acting\\nmade him a near-ideal interpreter. In spite of being handicapped by dark\\nglasses and a spooky white cape, Kerstin Witt as Mila's mother acted the\\ndisintegrating old harridan to the hilt.

Some of the\\nBrighton employees will switch to repair and service work but the overall\\nresult will be the loss of 10 jobs, reducing Elf's workforce to 22 people.\\nChris Crump, managing director of Elf, expects that the move to\\nsubcontracting will reduce production costs and relieve it of the burden of\\ncoping with an uneven order flow. (Remploy produces for many companies so it\\ncan control its own workload.)\\nElf, which has sales of Pounds 2m, will assemble kits of components and\\ndeliver them to Remploy though it may later arrange for its suppliers to\\ndeliver directly to the subcontractor.\\nCrump, who joined Elf a year ago to ginger up a flagging performance, says\\nhe considered moving production to Slough but this would still have required\\nhim to make a judgment on the size of the workforce he would need to meet\\nfluctuating demand. Sourcing products from the Far East was not an option\\neither because schools frequently require modifications to the standard\\nitems Elf supplies.\\nThe complexity of many products has meant that large companies in areas such\\nas automobile manufacture and engineering have long moved to extensive\\nsubcontracting of specialised components. Increasingly, smaller companies\\nare turning to subcontracting, either to reduce the cost of getting started\\nor to bring down the overheads of a long-established activity.\\nSmall and medium-sized businesses, those employing fewer than 500 people,\\naccount for no less than 82 per cent of Remploy's customers and 61 per cent\\nof its turnover, the company calculates.\\n'It is even more important for the smaller company, with its limited\\nresources, to focus on certain activities and subcontract out the rest,'\\nsays Brian Small, managing director of Ingersoll Engineers, a Rugby-based\\nconsultancy.\\nThe present recession, which has made companies even more aware of the need\\nto reduce costs, is providing a spur for more businesses to subcontract out\\nparts of their operations. Manufacturing savings, together with reductions\\nin other areas such as premises and stocks can allow businesses to finance\\nthe restructuring of their operations from their own resources, says Small.\\nFrequently the crunch comes when a business decides it needs to modernise\\nits production capacity. Gent, a Leicester-based manufacturer of fire\\ndetection and alarm equipment, took a hard look at its metal fabrication\\nshop when it was planning a move to a new factory.\\n'We had lots of ancient small presses and turning machines making rings,\\ncontacts, even screws,' says Andrew Robinson, managing director. 'We\\nrealised our main strength was electronics so we didn't want dirty, oily\\nactivities alongside. In addition our tooling was getting old and it would\\nhave taken a big investment to replicate.'\\nGent, which has sales of Pounds 24m and which forms part of RTZ Corporation,\\nshed most of its metal fabrication activities. The buy-in value of the\\nabandoned components was only Pounds 500,000 a year and the profit\\nimprovement was less than Pounds 100,000 but the saving in terms of the\\n'distraction value' to management of these peripheral activities was\\nsignificant, Robinson says.\\nBut there are further considerable benefits to be gained from buying in or\\nsubcontracting parts of a company's activities:\\nDeciding to buy in rather than make can have an important impact on the\\nmarket-awareness of a company, argues Brian Small. Companies which make a\\nfetish of manufacturing all or most of the components required are less\\nlikely to be oriented towards the needs of their customers.\\nSmall businesses may be able to improve quality control by handing over\\nresponsibility for manufacturing to a large, more sophisticated\\nsubcontractor. 'If something goes wrong Remploy's quality control can pick\\nit up,' says Robert Belcher, managing director of Manrose Manufacturing, a\\nsupplier of domestic fans. Both Remploy and Manrose's supplier of plastic\\nmouldings have obtained BS5750, the main UK standard for quality control,\\nbut Manrose itself has yet to qualify. Increasingly, customers are requiring\\nsuppliers to conform to this standard.\\nA subcontractor can help a customer even out uneven order flows and hold-ups\\nin the supply of components. Hayward Tyler Fluid Dynamics, a Luton-based\\nmanufacturer of specialised pumps, has subcontracted out fabrication and\\nplating operations accounting for 5-10 per cent of total activities as part\\nof a far-reaching restructuring programme. Hayward Tyler employs 250 people,\\ndown from 440, and has sales of Pounds 20m.\\n'This will give us flexibility,' says Roger Harrop, chief executive of\\nHayward Tyler and of its parent company, Sterling Fluid Systems. 'It will be\\neasier to switch off a subcontractor than our own people.' The company's\\nplating shop had anyway only been used for three days a month, he adds.\\nSub-contracting can also improve a company's cash flow. Instead of paying\\nweekly wages to the shop floor workforce the company moves to paying the\\nsubcontractor on 30 or 60-day terms. The company can also set the cost of\\nthe subcontractor's services immediately against profits whereas investment\\nin capital equipment usually takes place over a number of years.\\nBut the decision to subcontract out parts or even all of a business's\\nmanufacturing operations can be highly charged. Some companies believe the\\nbenefits of subcontracting outweigh the loss of total control of their\\nactivities. Others are sensitive about admitting that they are sticking\\ntheir own label on someone else's product.\\nProduction specialists say that before considering whether to buy-in rather\\nthan make a particular item managers must decide which activities are core\\nto their company's survival. High value items and products which involve\\nconfidential design features and manufacturing techniques should always be\\nmade in-house, says James Byers of Ingersoll Engineers. Stock items such as\\nnuts, bolts, bearings and washers, or loss-makers essential to the company's\\nrange should be contracted out.\\nIn addition, managers must be prepared for a short-term disruption of\\nproduction when they subcontract work out. 'We had a few teething problems\\nin the first six months,' says Gent's Andrew Robinson. 'It was not easy to\\nget someone else to make items which our own skilled workers had been making\\nfor 20 years.'\\nManagers must monitor the relationship with the subcontractor very closely.\\nOne start-up business which subcontracted out the plastic injection moulding\\non which it depended was set back for a year when it was forced to replace a\\nlarge number of products which customers returned as being faulty. 'We\\nassumed there would be someone at the subcontractor who had an overall view\\nof the project but there wasn't,' says the company's executive director.\\nBut the difficulties do not always lie with the subcontractor. Companies are\\nfrequently unrealistic in their forecasts of production volumes, says Edward\\nSelby, business manager of Remploy's southern region factories. Managers\\nsometimes misjudge the market for their product but they may also\\ndeliberately exaggerate volumes to negotiate a keen price from the\\nsubcontractor.\\nNor is it unknown for managers to order wildly excessive volumes of raw\\nmaterials. 'If a customer thinks his product will sell for a number of years\\nhe buys a massive quantity of raw materials. If a juggernaut pulls up\\noutside your door with three years' worth of materials it is difficult to\\ntell the customer you can't let them in,' Selby explains. Subcontracting\\nshould not be seen as an easy way of disposing of the complexities of\\nrunning a manufacturing operation, the experts warn. But properly handled it\\ncan have a significant impact on costs and on the ability of a smaller\\ncompany to service its customers.\",\n",

Two years ago, an EC directive was drafted with the aim of\\nharmonising measures to outlaw software piracy across the member states.\\nIt specifically forbade unauthorised reverse engineering - analysing a piece\\nof software to understand what its does and how it does it. That proposal\\nwas flawed in that while reverse engineering is used by software pirates, it\\nis also a key technology for computer manufacturers. They need to be able to\\nattach their equipment to that of their competitors; computer users have to\\nbe able to modify and extend their existing software.\\nIt is unlikely the authors of the draft fully understood the implications of\\ntheir work. The directive suited PC software suppliers and the larger\\nmanufacturers - namely IBM and Digital Equipment - but outraged their\\nsmaller competitors and customers. The competitors, including Groupe Bull\\nand Olivetti, formed a lobby called the European Committee for Interoperable\\nSystems (ECIS); users formed the Computer Users of Europe.\\nThere was a second dimension. IBM and Digital saw the directive as a way of\\ndefending their software against the Japanese. The issue became a war or\\nwords fought between the US and Japan in the cockpit of Europe.\\nCommissioners in Brussels and Members of the European Parliament in\\nStrasbourg are by now no doubt heartily sick of the issue. They have been\\nlobbied mercilessly by representatives from all sides of the dispute for the\\npast 12 months.\\nA compromise solution or 'Common Position' was reached in December which\\nproved satisfactory to the software suppliers and the big computer\\nmanufacturers, but left ECIS together with computer users across Europe\\nconcerned about the legitimacy of reverse engineering for maintenance or to\\nfacilitate the interconnection of one maker's computer with another.\\nThese issues were addressed in a series of amendments which came before the\\nEuropean parliament last week. Some 235 MEPs voted for the amendments, 89\\nvoted against and 197 abstained. But under EC rules a minimum of 260 MEPs\\nhave to vote in favour of an issue for it to pass.\\nThe directive now goes back to Brussels for final ratification later this\\nyear. Some nations - the Netherlands, Italy and Spain among them - are\\nexpected to adopt the measures as they stand; France, Germany and the UK\\nwill have to modify their existing copyright law.\\nThe overall result is that the big manufacturers and the software suppliers\\nseem to have all they wanted; the smaller manufacturers are discontented but\\nprepared to live within the terms of the directive while users are confused\\nand angry.\\nWhat is now likely to happen is a series of court battles in each member\\nstate as users squabble among themselves to define the exact interpretation\\nof the directive with regard to reverse engineering. There is still the\\npossibility that new proposals can be put to the Commission after the\\neffects of the directive have been assessed in practice. Perhaps the\\ncommission's own drafting mechanism would benefit from a spot of reverse\\nengineering?\",\n",

They influence customer loyalty, product differentiation and\\nprofit margins. According to Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler: 'The company\\nwith the best distribution systems and service level will win all the\\nmarbles.'\\nIn short, advanced logistics is no longer a luxury. One consequence of this\\nshift is the emergence of a new type of wholesale service company where\\ndistribution is just as important as the product that is shipped.\\nTake paper clips. If you are an office products wholesaler, how do you get\\nretailers to buy such a simple, undifferentiated item from you, rather than\\nfrom any number of your competitors?\\nThe answer, in the US at least, is 'value-added' distribution. United\\nStationers, the country's biggest office products distributor, can sell and\\nship a single pencil or one box of paper clips and still make a profit.\\nThe same is true on all 25,000 items in its catalogue, from pens to filing\\ncabinets. And if a customer places an order by 6.00 pm it will be delivered\\nby 9.00 am the next morning to any location in the US.\\nNot surprisingly, this demands an extensive physical operation. United\\nStationers, based near Chicago, sells products from around 400 manufacturers\\nto some 10,000 retailers across the US, via 14 regional distribution\\ncentres.\\nThis physical network is entirely dependent on a complex computing and\\ntelecommunications infrastructure: Amdahl 5995 and IBM 3090 mainframes\\nsupported by robotic storage devices from Storage Technology as well as\\ntelephone and satellite communications networks. In all an incremental\\ninvestment of some Dollars 200m (Pounds 115m).\\nUnited's customers obtain information on the company's inventory via a\\ncomputer network which connects their machines to United's system of 1,400\\nPCs. This automates the ordering process and allows clients to see whether\\nUnited has a particular product in stock.\\n'Our customers enter upwards of 70 per cent of our orders for us,' says\\nPatrick Murray, IT vice president. 'We do it in lots of different ways. We\\ntalk to everybody's computer. We do it in batch mode, we do it online -\\nhowever a customer requires it.'\\nUltimately, Murray expects United's terminals to be on the desks of his\\ncustomers' customers too, and he intends to apply the same technology to\\nlinks with his own suppliers.\\nOrdering is only part of the value-added process. The sooner the retailer\\nknows that United has shipped goods, the sooner he can bill his customer and\\ncollect his money, says Murray. Similarly United uses the system to get the\\nlatest manufacturers' pricing information to these retailers, so that they\\ncan manage their prices too.\\nGiving retailers such access to and control over the ordering and inventory\\nprocess, and the imperative to turn orders around in hours, has had serious\\nimplications for United's warehousing operation.\\nItems are not stored in pre-defined areas. Rather, they are put in the next\\navailable bin, as dictated by United's disparate product range: boxes of\\npencils and desks do not take up the same shaped space. The warehouse map is\\ncomputer-controlled and the system tracks every individual batch of items.\\nSurprisingly, this random binning is not completely arbitrary. The system is\\nable to analyse the inventory and track 'hot' products - high moving items -\\nand guide them to where they are most accessible.\\nWhen a piece of inventory is manually put into store, staff use radio\\nfrequency data entry terminals, complete with bar-coded reading guns, to\\nupdate the control system directly on line.\\nThe logical extension of all this, says Murray, is to use similar tools and\\nthe same bar code in the transportation and delivery process so that a\\ndriver can verify that the right carton has been dropped at the right door,\\nand give proof of delivery. United hopes to introduce such an innovation\\nthis year.\\nThe same integrated technology feeds United's sales and marketing effort.\\nIts primary marketing tool is a catalogue of products, and United publishes\\nand distributes some 4m copies a year.\\nBut because the catalogue becomes out of date almost immediately after it is\\nissued (with products being added or dropped), Murray has to provide regular\\nupdates. He is hoping in the near future, however, to produce an electronic\\ncatalogue, with colour pictures, dimension data and moving price\\ninformation.\\nAt the hub of United's operation is a central IT development and operations\\nstaff. Typically this is pared to the bone - 40 people to manage data and\\nvoice communications, systems operations and a help desk (there is no\\ncomputer expertise in the regional centres). In addition, Murray has 100\\nstaff in applications development and product introduction.\\nThe effect of this technological commitment is two fold, Murray says. First,\\nUnited has grown significantly - it is now a Dollars 1bn company, and one of\\njust four national office products distributors in the US. Second, its\\ntechnology culture has enabled United to set pioneering service levels.\\nFor example, Murray explains: 'We are doing lots of small orders. About 80\\nper cent of what we sell is not in the same packaging that it came to us in.\\nWe don't sell a whole carton of paper - we'll sell one ream. Now the service\\nwe provide for our reseller says you go out to each of your customers and\\nyou take the orders the way they want them.\\n'You send the orders to us and we'll package them in such a way that they\\ncan be delivered directly to the end user and you don't have to add labour.\\nWhen we put the label on the box the label says it came from you not from\\nus. Our dealer doesn't have to handle the merchandise at all. The most\\nprofitable dealer is the guy who never sees the merchandise, absolutely\\nnever sees it at all.'\\nThe downside is that higher expectations become institutionalised. Because\\nUnited delivers anywhere in the US by the following day, and guarantees to\\nbe in stock on all of its inventory, that has become the service norm.\\nSimilarly United cannot afford to let up on its technical innovation. Murray\\nclaims that the company currently has a lead of six to 12 months, but 'the\\ncompetition is pretty good at copying - so we better have the next thing\\ncoming up to keep the gap open. To get the order we've got to be the easiest\\ncompany to do business with,' he says.\",\n",

This information consists of a string of\\nnumbers which defines the precise location of the computer to be collected,\\nincluding the aisle, shelf and position of the computer in its box as well\\nas the order for the computers to be stacked, with the most robust equipment\\nat the bottom.

       " 'FT911-3886': \"FOSTER AND OTHERS v BRITISH GAS PLC House of Lords (Lord Keith, Lord\\nTempleman, Lord Ackner and Lord Jauncey): April 18 1991\\nBRITISH GAS is a state controlled statutory body with special monopoly\\npowers for the provision of public services and accordingly, though it is a\\ncommercial enterprise, its employees, like public sector employees, can rely\\ndirectly on the European Community equal treatment Directive when\\ncomplaining of a discriminatory retirement policy operating before UK\\nenactment of equality legislation.\\nThe House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by Mrs M Foster and five\\nother female employees of British Gas plc (formerly the British Gas\\nCorporation), from a Court of Appeal decision that they were not in a\\nposition to seek compensation against British Gas for discrimination on\\ngrounds of sex.\\nLORD TEMPLEMAN said that article 5 of the EC equal treatment Directive of\\nFebruary 9 1976, provided that member states of the EC should apply the\\nprinciple of equal treatment to working conditions, so that 'men and women\\nshall be guaranteed the same conditions without discrimination on grounds of\\nsex'.\\nThe UK took the view that the Directive did not render unlawful a rule that\\nmen and women must retire at pensionable age, even if that meant that women\\nmust retire at 60 whereas men need not retire before 65.\\nIn Marshall (1986) QB 401 the European Court of Justice ruled that a general\\npolicy of retiring women when they reached pensionable age at 60 and men\\nwhen they reached pensionable age at 65, was an infringement of the equal\\ntreatment Directive.\\nThe Court reiterated that a member state which had not adopted measures to\\ngive effect to the Directive 'may not plead as against individuals, its own\\nfailure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails'.\\nIt ruled that where a person involved in legal proceedings was able to rely\\non a Directive as against the state, he might do so regardless of the\\ncapacity in which the state was acting, whether employer or public\\nauthority. It said, 'In either case it is necessary to prevent the state\\nfrom taking advantage of its own failure to comply with Community law.'\\nAs a result of Marshall section 2 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, which\\ncame into force on November 7 1987, rendered unlawful any discrimination by\\nany person against a woman in relation to retirement age, so that the\\nanomaly between employees in the public sector who could rely on the equal\\ntreatment Directive, and employees in the private sector who could not, was\\neliminated.\\nThe position remained, however, that a woman in the public sector who was\\ndiscriminated against by retirement between February 9 1976 and November 7\\n1987, might be able to obtain compensation for breach of the Directive.\\nBritish Gas had a policy that women should retire at 60 and men at 65. It\\ninfringed the Directive. The appellant employees were compulsorily retired\\nbetween December 27 1985 and July 22 1986. They claimed compensation for\\nunlawful discrimination.\\nThe House of Lords referred to the European Court the question whether\\nBritish Gas was a body of such a type that the appellants were entitled to\\nrely directly on the Directive.\\nThe Court gave its ruling on July 12 1990.\\nBy paragraph 22 it said that article 5 (1) of the Directive might be relied\\non in a claim for damages against 'a body whatever its legal form which has\\nbeen made responsible, pursuant to a measure adopted by the state, for\\nproviding a public service under the control of the state and has for that\\npurpose special powers beyond those which result from the normal rules\\napplicable in relations between individuals'.\\nAccordingly, the question for the House was whether British Gas was such a\\nbody.\\nBy the 1972 Gas Act, replacing the 1965 Act and repealed by the 1986 Act,\\nthe British Gas Corporation was established as a body corporate. The\\nsecretary of state was authorised to make regulations with regard to the\\nappointment, tenure and vacation of office by Corporation members. Section 2\\nprovided that it was the Corporation's duty to develop and maintain an\\nefficient and co-ordinated system of gas supply for Great Britain.\\nThus British Gas was a body which was made responsible pursuant to a measure\\nadopted by the state, for providing a public service.\\nBy section 4 the Corporation was directed to report to the minister, who was\\nauthorised to give it appropriate directions for securing its efficient\\nmanagement. By section 7 he was authorised to give it general directions as\\nto the exercise and performance of its functions in relation to matters\\naffecting national interest. By section 8 it was ordered to report annually\\nto the minister on the exercise and performance of its functions, policy and\\nprogrammes.\\nBy section 29 of the 1972 Act, 'no person other than the Corporation shall .\\n. . supply gas to any premises except with the consent of the Corporation'.\\nThat section conferred on British Gas 'special powers beyond those which\\nresult from the normal duties applicable in relations between individuals'.\\nAccordingly, British Gas was a body which was made responsible pursuant to a\\nmeasure adopted by the state for providing a public service under the\\ncontrol of the state and had, for that purpose, special powers beyond those\\nwhich resulted from the normal rules applicable in relations between\\nindividuals.\\nBritish Gas could therefore not take advantage of the state's failure to\\ncomply with the equal treatment Directive.\\nThe appellants' complaints of unlawful discrimination were dismissed by the\\nindustrial tribunal and the Court of Appeal on the ground that, for the\\npurposes of the Directive, British Gas was a private individual against whom\\nthe Directive could not be enforced.\\nBefore the European Court and before the House, British Gas repeated the\\narguments which had found favour in the courts below. It submitted it was a\\nstatutory corporation engaged in commercial activities; it did not perform\\nany of the traditional functions of the state; and it was not the agent of\\nthe state. It argued that the European Court could not have intended to made\\nthe Directive enforceable against a commercial concern.\\nThose submissions were irrelevant to the tests laid down in the Court's\\nruling.\\nThe sole question were whether British Gas, pursuant to a measure adopted by\\nthe state, provided a public service under the control of the state, and\\nexercised special powers.\\nBritish Gas submitted that the secretary of state did not possess the\\ncontrol contemplated by the Court because it had wide powers in the\\nperformance of its functions. It submitted that monopoly in the supply of\\ngas was not a 'special power' contemplated by the Court, and that the Court\\nin its ruling had not clearly provided that nationalised industries carrying\\nout commercial functions were to be regarded as organs of the state.\\nThe principle laid down by the European Court was that the state must not be\\nallowed to take advantage of its own failure to comply with EC law.\\nBritish Gas's policy was no doubt thought to be in its commercial interests.\\nThe advantages of that policy would accrue indirectly to the state which\\nprovided, through British Gas, a supply of gas for citizens generally and\\nwas entitled to surplus revenue. If British Gas were allowed to escape the\\nconsequences of an admitted breach of the Directive, the state would be\\ntaking advantage of its own failure to comply with EC law.\\nIn those circumstances there was no justification for a narrow or strained\\nconstruction of the Court's ruling.\\nApplying the words of the ruling, the 1972 Act created a body which provided\\na public service to citizens generally under the control of the state, which\\ncould dictate its policies and retain its surplus revenue. British Gas had a\\nspecial monopoly power created by the legislature. It was therefore a body\\nagainst which the Directive might be enforced.\\nThe appeal was allowed. The proceedings were restored to the industrial\\ntribunal to assess compensation.\\nTheir Lordships agreed.\\nFor the appellant employees: James Goudie QC and John Cavanagh (Bruce Piper\\n& Co).\\nFor British Gas: Michael Beloff QC and Elizabeth Slade (CEH Twiss, British\\nGas solicitor).\",\n",

Mr Derek Howatt, chief\\nfinancial officer, says the purchase may push the government into an\\noperating deficit this year.\\nStill, the legislative council is unlikely to reject the sale. Mr Robson,\\nlike most councillors, says it is worth paying a premium to wrest control of\\nthe islands' economy from FIC, which, established by royal charter in 1852,\\nwielded almost feudal powers in the Falklands until the 1970s.\\nNaturally, many people are questioning the wisdom of making the government a\\nbig landowner at a time when state economic intervention is being rolled\\nback all over the world. However, Mr Ronald Sampson, the government chief\\nexecutive, says: 'We will take a very hard commercial line in running the\\nbusiness. But we will not announce redundancies in the medium term. If (the\\nfarms) have no long term future they will be allowed to go to the wall.'\\nThe government can also be criticised for failing to loosen FIC's grip over\\nthe islands' economy. Its shipping, retail and service operations remain\\nintact. These sectors are probably the most lucrative part of FIC's\\noperation.\\nAlthough Anglo United refused a government offer to buy FIC outright, it\\ndecided to give the government 'for no consideration' a half-share in its\\nsubsidiary Darwin Shipping. Darwin is a charter company that handles nearly\\nall the islands' foreign trade. By making the government a partner, FIC\\nprobably expects it will be less anxious to break its oligopoly.\\nStrangely, the sale has highlighted the islanders' lack of self-confidence.\\nThe Falklands remain very much a colony with appointed officials such as Mr\\nSampson running local government. All big decisions must first be approved\\nin London, sometimes at cabinet level.\\nBritish officials say in private that the islanders often fail to grasp\\ncomplex issues, such as the land deal, fully. For their part, islanders fear\\nthat the British government subordinates their interests to its own\\npolitical aims.\\nConspiracy theorists suspect that obscure geopolitical or vested interests\\nwere the 'real' reason behind the land sale. They say the government was\\nsuspiciously quick to accept a sale that may not be in the islands' best\\ninterests.\\nThe Falklands have grown rich quickly through the sale of fishing licences.\\nThis year licences will raise Pounds 23.7m for the treasury. The government\\nhad earlier convinced the islanders to save as much of the windfall as\\npossible. But now it has agreed to a deal that will cost this year's budget\\nsurplus.\\nMr Ray Evans, a farmer, says: 'If they could only give a solid reason for\\npaying such a high price, it would calm a lot of people.'\\nBut Mr Rodney Lee, once a farm hand and now the owner of a successful sheep\\nfarm, summarises the islanders' dilemma: 'I've done a lot of bowing and\\nscraping in my time. We have been dictated to all our lives. All that ended\\nafter the (1982 Argentine) invasion. But we don't have many local people who\\nare qualified to take complex decisions.'\",\n",

This is creating uncertainty which is knocking business\\nconfidence - yesterday the local stock market plummeted by 2.32 per cent,\\nthe biggest fall since the start of the Gulf conflict last August.\\nHong Kong's colonial government has also lost points recently to China on\\nthree other occasions while trying to defend its constitutional rights.\\nThe latest occurred yesterday when Mr Gordon Wu, a prominent construction\\nentrepreneur, was invited to Peking for talks on plans drawn up by a group\\nof Hong Kong Chinese property developers to take over the project and\\nfinance it themselves for about HKDollars 60bn.\\nMr Wu's ace card would be to suggest to China that he and the other\\ndevelopers could build the airport rapidly after 1997 if Hong Kong refuses\\nto come to terms in the next few weeks. Infuriated Hong Kong government\\nofficials see this as a spoiling tactic at a time when they are trying to\\npersuade China to come to terms.\\nAnother loss on points came last week after Hong Kong refused to publicise\\ndetails of its options for the project, despite considerable local pressure.\\nTop Peking officials provocatively said that they were willing to publish\\ntheir ideas as soon as Hong Kong agreed, so that local people could judge\\nwhich alternative they prefer. This led to an outspoken debate in the\\ncolony's Legislative Council last Wednesday when legislators turned on\\nBritain and Hong Kong, not China.\\nBut perhaps most humiliating of all was a lecture read to Hong Kong\\nofficials recently by China about fiscal discipline, control of public\\nborrowings, and maintenance of fiscal reserves. This was not a new line,\\nbecause China has been arguing that the airport project will drain reserves\\nand weaken the economy before 1997.\\nThe humiliation arose because the Chinese, who are not themselves renowned\\nfor strong fiscal discipline, read the lecture from Hong Kong's 1979 budget\\nspeech delivered by Sir Philip Haddon-Cave, the then powerful financial\\nsecretary. The inference was that, in order to build a massive British\\nmemorial to over 150 years of colonial rule, Hong Kong's current top\\nofficials had over-ridden the strict financial ethics on which the colony\\nhad thrived.\\nChina acknowledges a new airport is needed to replace existing congested\\nfacilities. But it has been objecting to the plans since late 1989,\\ninitially for a mixture of political and economic reasons. Now it is seeking\\na continuing say on the project - for example the right to examine financial\\nborrowing and contract decisions - in addition to having seats on an airport\\nauthority board. 'It wants control,' says a senior official.\\nHong Kong says it is only prepared to consult China. It argues that any\\nfurther consensus-seeking measures would slow the project and establish a\\nprecedent for China to gain virtual control of other medium- and long-term\\neconomic and fiscal decisions before 1997.\\nHong Kong's aim now is to persuade China that it is not bluffing when it\\nsays that it would prefer to shelve (or effectively cancel) the project and\\nexpand its existing Kai Tak airport. This refusal to give Peking a precedent\\nfor control is backed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, who\\nfailed to reach agreement during a recent visit to Peking and who would have\\nto sanction any final breakdown with the Chinese.\\nThe airport is now estimated to cost HKDollars 100bn at 1990 prices and is\\nthe world's largest new infrastructure project apart from Gulf\\nreconstruction.\\nOfficials had hoped the private sector would finance 40 to 60 per cent of\\nthe HKDollars 127bn plans (at 1988 prices) originally announced in 1989,\\nwhich included linked port developments to be carried out later.\\nRecently it has emerged that the expected private sector element has dropped\\nto only about 25 per cent of the HKDollars 100bn - including bonds, loans,\\nequity stakes and franchises for parts of the airport.\\nBut whatever the percentage, the government now believes that China's\\nsupport is essential. It fears China would attack the project if there were\\nno agreement and that this would scare off financial backers because\\nfranchise periods and debt repayments would not start before 1997.\\nIt might even deter six pre-qualified international construction consortia\\nwhich are now waiting to be invited to submit tenders for the Lantau Fixed\\nLink. Business confidence, on which Hong Kong depends, would slump.\\nPolitics apart, Hong Kong could build the airport without the private\\nsector. It has HKDollars 75bn of basic fiscal reserves, plus an Exchange\\nFund which has a secret amount of accumulated investment earnings, believed\\nto be about HKDollars 50bn-70bn (in addition to HKDollars 40bn needed to\\nprop up the currency and about HKDollars 60bn transferred temporarily as\\ninvestments from the fiscal reserves).\\nMost of the Exchange Fund earnings could be used for the airport, but the\\ngovernment does not regard this as a viable option because it would be\\nstrenuously opposed by China and, possibly, by Hong Kong people.\\nSo the future of the project before 1997 depends on agreement with China.\\nThis is a dramatic turnround from two years ago, when Hong Kong saw no need\\neven to consult Peking fully on the plans. As late as last year top\\nofficials were saying they would go ahead on their own if China did not fall\\ninto line, using public sources for the bulk of the funds.\\nHong Kong is learning painfully about China's determination to protect its\\ninheritence over the final six years of British rule.\",\n",

It can be\\napplied to virtually every facet of software. In the last couple of years\\ndatabases, languages, design methods and systems architectures have all\\nbecome object-oriented.\\nHowever, behind the awkward American-English (it should, of course, be\\nobject-orientated), there is a serious intent.\\nObject-oriented design suddenly achieved a higher level of legitimacy when,\\nlast month, the important US software company Microsoft announced its\\nmembership of the Object Management Group (OMG), an industry group founded\\nto promote object-oriented standards. IBM is expected to follow and OMG can\\nnow boast all of the prime movers in software technology as its members.\\nOMG was founded in 1989 by a group of companies who wanted to push the\\nobject-oriented approach into the limelight and supervise the creation of\\ncommon standards. Membership has tripled in the last year and now numbers\\nover 100.\\nAlthough OMG is primarily a technical body, it will exert a crucial\\ninfluence over the design of future computer systems. The concepts of\\nobject-oriented design reach into the heart of information technology\\nsystems and the OMG and its members will be responsible for laying the\\nfoundations of the new order.\\nThat IBM and Microsoft should suddenly make their interest public at this\\ntime is no surprise. The commercial exploitation of object-oriented design\\nis just beginning, with bullish predictions for growth for tools which\\nconform to the emerging standards.\\nIn a report sponsored by the OMG, Ovum, the UK researcher, forecasts a\\nEuropean market worth Dollars 196m this year, rising to Dollars 1.6bn by\\n1996. The US market is expected to be even larger with total product\\nrevenues of more than Dollars 2bn by 1996.\\nOvum's analysis is based on growth in three areas: languages and tools,\\ndevelopers' tools, databases and CASE tools. 'Object technology has emerged\\nfrom the early days of religious fervour and is experiencing rapid\\nacceptance,' says Ovum.\\nAlthough it is a new way of looking at computer systems, object-oriented\\ndesign has its roots in the past. The approach views computer systems as a\\nset of objects, which can be directly related to objects in the real world.\\nAn invoice is an object; a manufactured product is an object and they are\\nboth represented as such within an object-oriented computer system.\\nObject-oriented design evolved out of the same research at Xerox Palo Alto\\nResearch Centre (PARC) which produced the windows-icon-mouse-pointer\\ninterface popularised on the Apple Macintosh.\\nSimilar interfaces, such as Microsoft's Windows 3, are also available for\\nIBM-compatible personal computers.\\nThe Apple Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows 3 are both described as\\nobject-oriented interfaces and, while this is true, the object-oriented\\ntechnology goes much further than a better user interface.\\nObject-oriented evangelists in the software industry talk of a paradigm\\nshift in thinking about how computer systems can be built.\\nObjet-oriented design includes several important ideas which help to clarify\\nsystems design and make better use of existing technology.\\nThe formal definition of object-oriented systems covers useful concepts such\\nas inheritance and code re-use. Inheritance allows different objects to\\nshare the same characteristics. All invoices, for example must contain an\\ninvoice date - a characteristic which is inherited by every object called an\\ninvoice.\\nThe re-use of code is of more pragmatic use and can be seen in some personal\\ncomputer software. A PC equipped with Microsoft Windows 3, for example, will\\nuse the same display-screen driver program (the software which sorts out\\ntext and graphics) in many different applications.\\nLanguage developers are in the frontline in object-oriented technology with\\nMicrosoft and Borland both offering language compilers which are described\\nas object-oriented.\\nDatabase developments have been restricted to specialist suppliers such as\\nObjectivity and Ontologic. But both Oracle and Ingres among others are\\nreported to working on the technology and will deliver products later in the\\n1990s.\\nSuppliers of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, especially\\nthose at the technical end of the market, have been at the forefront of the\\ntechnology with US companies such as Interactive Data Environments (IDE) and\\nCadre Technologies leading the way.\\nMore important, the OMG is well on the way to formulating the first of the\\nstandards which will allow object-oriented systems to work across different\\ncomputer systems.\\nThe OMG published its draft architectural specification last year and has\\nrequested tenders for the technology which will form the core of a method to\\ncontrol objects and the communications between them.\\nLater this year it is expected to publish a formal definition of what an\\nobject is and this is likely to spur on the tool, language and database\\nproviders to produce object-oriented products.\\nObject-oriented design promises to change computer systems design beyond\\nrecognition in the next decade. One of the advantages of the approach is\\nthat it opens the door to computing power - what was once called programming\\n -to a much wider audience.\\nAlthough complex objects, such as invoice transactions, will still need\\nprofessional expertise, less crucial processes can be engineered by users\\nthemselves.\\nThey will be able to combine their objects with those that already exist\\nwithin a system and produce their own customised working environments.\",\n",

It is an expert system which performs\\npreliminary interviewing and delivers some guideline judgments to the human\\ninterviewer.\\nThis is a typical example of what expert systems are supposed to do -\\ndistill the expertise of individuals and deliver them in rule-based systems.\\nFive years ago, there were predictions that expert systems would be a good\\narea for software sales, comparable with spreadsheets in the 1980s. By\\ndrawing on the advice of expert systems, not-so-expert people would be\\nenabled to perform skilled tasks with the minimum of training, a process\\ndescribed as de-skilling.\\nIn fact, the expectations have been largely disappointed: some of the most\\nvaunted expert systems pioneers have collapsed in the shake-out of the last\\ncouple of years.\\nFrom the Japanese, who so publicly waved the banner of Artificial\\nIntelligence (AI) research as a platform for government investment, very\\nlittle has emerged. Expert systems are nevertheless the most visible of all\\nthe AI techniques to have surfaced in commerce.\\nExpert systems have become the domain of a few small specialised companies,\\nworking in niche markets, rather than a recognisable market sector. However,\\nthey have penetrated various unrelated niche markets, not by presenting any\\nmystique-laden breakthrough, but by integrating with software that users\\nknow and understand.\\nThe story of the STARS product is typical of niche usage, because it uses an\\nexpert front-end to accepted psychometric testing techniques. The system is\\nfor use by in-house interviewers, and has been designed to help non-experts\\n(rather than personnel specialists) through the first tricky and\\ntime-consuming steps of staff interviewing.\\nMr Schollick, of European Personnel Counsellors based in Buckinghamshire,\\nhas built his interviewing skills into STARS II. His expertise is packaged\\nin the wording of the questions, and in the expert rules which dictate which\\nquestions the system asks.\\nSTARS II chooses its own path through the labyrinth of up to 300 questions\\nper interview, selecting the questions in the light of the previous answers.\\nIt delivers judgments from a possible 2,000 descriptions - along with\\ncarefully-worded suggested questions to probe sensitive areas.\\nThese help the human interviewer prepare for the face-to-face interview that\\nno computer can emulate or replace. STARS supplies a consistency of decision\\nmaking, and a short cut in assessing applicants.\\nThis is typical of the niche approach. Expert systems seem to be winning\\nacceptance largely as an extension of other applications, and particularly\\nin industries which are comfortable with advanced technology.\\nThe best known examples come from finance and industry. One Australian bank\\nuses an expert system to judge credit card applications. In the UK, ICI uses\\nthe technique to assist paint analysis. The Financial Times Business\\nInformation report on Successful Expert Systems, published in 1989, cited 20\\nlarge UK organisations using expert systems, including a few in mainstream\\nareas.\\nMr Tim Johnson, director of London-based research company Ovum, points to\\nthe commercial basis which is necessary to win wide acceptance of any AI\\ntechniques.\\n'A lot of systems are for diagnostics - problem tracking of some sort, or\\nproviding consultancy, everything in fact from diagnosing medical conditions\\nto finding errors in the production process for gas turbines. Another\\ninteresting usage is as a front end to access text databases, to help find\\nthe way through the maze of what information is available,' says Mr Johnson.\\nOvum's report on the European market for expert systems, Knowledge Based\\nSystems: Markets, Suppliers and Products, puts the total for product\\nrevenues in expert systems at Dollars 70m in 1990 with US revenues of\\nDollars 128m: excluding expenditure on consultancy and customisation.\\nMr Johnson notes that the UK, once a hotbed of development, no longer\\nprovides Ovum with ready examples of advanced technology. In part, he blames\\nthe dissolution of the UK Alvey programme, which funded a number of AI\\nresearch projects, although there are some signs of life in the AI\\ncommunity, and Ovum is about to publish a new report on Natural Language,\\nthe first update since 1985.\\n'Since Alvey declined, we've had to travel to France or the US to find the\\nlatest technology, there seem to be fewer people in the UK to talk to. The\\nUS in particular has progressed more rapidly because US companies were quick\\nto adapt when they realised that the early products of research were not\\nquite what people wanted,' he explains.\\nNeuron Data, the US company Ovum cites as having the largest share of the\\nexpert systems market in Europe, has just opened a UK direct sales operation\\nin London, a sign of its confidence in the future.\\nNeuron Data sells Nexpert Object, an expert 'shell' which puts the emphasis\\non integration. This means working with existing databases, on over 30\\ndifferent platforms, including Macintosh, PCs, workstations, minis, and IBM\\nmainframes, and with different graphical user-interfaces for ease of use.\\n'Expert systems are just another software technology,' says Mr Richard Stow,\\nNeuron Data's UK sales and marketing manager who would like to distance\\nexpert systems from the AI tag.\\n'To customers it's just one technology among many others. The old world of\\nAI - to which Neuron Data never subscribed - was about specialist hardware,\\nvery complex software needing esoteric programing skills, systems with\\nguru-level intelligence which learn from experience - no mention of\\nintegration or portability. The old world has gone: what predominates is now\\na view of expert systems from the developer's perspective,' says Mr Stow.\\nHe divides Neuron Data users into three categories; the end users, the\\nproviders of packaged software, and systems integrators such as Andersen\\nConsulting. Among notable US Nexpert users are Manufacturers Hanover Trust,\\nwhich has built a system called Inspector, for monitoring fraudulent or\\nhigh-risk deals, and computer manufacturer Tandem, which uses online expert\\ndiagnostics for its Integrity S2 system.\\nMr Stow believes the UK market is probably 12-18 months behind the US in\\nterms of take-up of expert system technology, but it will catch up.\\nAndersen Consulting has about 25 users worldwide, including four UK sites\\nfor its Expert Configurator which is built on to the MAC-PAC manufacturing\\n(MRP II) package on IBM AS400s. The expert front end allows the user to\\nmatch up a specific task needing certain machines with existing tasks and\\nschedules.\\n'We'd like to think that expert systems are becoming a mainstream\\ntechnology,' concludes Mr Stow.

It has caused businesses to re-evaluate their use of\\ninformation technology and promised to change the skill needs of the\\nindustry. Software engineering makes labour-intensive program coding\\nobsolete and offers greater control over the design and maintenance of\\nsoftware.\\nIn spite of significant backing from industry leaders such as IBM and DEC,\\nthe engineering approach has not delivered its expected promise. Its\\nsupporters face new challenges. The shift away from proprietary, monolithic\\nsystems to multi-vendor, networked systems makes it harder to build\\ninformation technology systems and has increased the pressure on software\\nengineers.\\nMr Richard Barker, head of Oracle Software's software engineering\\noperations, says this is the biggest problem facing the software industry in\\nthe 1990s. 'The problem of designing one logical program to run across\\nmultiple hardware platforms will occupy the next few years,' he says.\\nThe engineering approach will play a leading role in solving the problem.\\nUntil quite recently, software production was haphazard and mysterious. Good\\nresults were achieved by a mixture of luck and schooled intuition.\\nHowever, in the 1980s the engineering analogy grew in credibility and\\nsoftware production was increasingly seen as a craft rather than an art. It\\nwas subject to scientific laws and the design and production of a computer\\nprogram could be defined in the same way that an engineer specifies a bridge\\nor a motor car.\\nThis change coincided with increased use of computers as design aids across\\nindustry. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) - and the workstation technology it\\ninspired - could be applied equally well to software design and developers\\nquickly discovered how to apply it to their own products.\\nThe results were lumped together under the umbrella name of computer-aided\\nsoftware engineering (Case) and packaged up for a market, eager to find ways\\nto build better software at low cost.\\nSoftware pioneers such as Mr James Martin went as far as to say that the\\napplication of formal engineering methods to business systems design not\\nonly improved the quality of software, they could also give a business edge\\nin the market.\\nThe vision is yet to be fulfilled. For every moderate success, there is\\nequal evidence of failure.\\nConsultant Butler Cox noted in a report, published at the end of the 1980s,\\nthat Case tools only worked successfully, where a formal design method -\\nsuch as Mr Martin's information engineering - had been introduced. In other\\nwords, the principles of systems engineering must precede the use of\\nsoftware engineering tools.\\nHowever, there are other reasons for the apparent slow progress.\\nMr John Lowrie, who worked with Mr Martin on Information Engineering\\nFacility and now leads Information Architechs, puts some of the blame on\\nconsultants: 'The consulting world took over the whole concept of Case and\\nit resulted in complete culture shock in user computer departments. Case\\nchanges the skill needs - de-skilling the programming back-end job and\\nre-skilling the front end analysis and design.\\n'It is a fundamental change and means that companies need a lot of change\\nmanagement - an ideal market for consultants,' says Mr Lowrie.\\nHe sees this attitude running against real advances in the software\\ntechnology: 'Consultants are not interested in producing the best software\\ntechnology - they just want to put in armies of consultants.'\\nA more compelling reason for the failures of software engineering is that\\nthe technological goalposts have moved.\\nEarly Case tools were conceived at a time when software was built for a\\nsingle machine and operating environment - usually a large IBM mainframe or\\na DEC minicomputer.\\nThe information technology systems of the 1990s will be based on networks of\\nPCs, clusters of database 'servers' and high-speed transaction processing\\ncomputers.\\n'The current tools were based on the software technology of 1983-84. We are\\nnow moving into second-generation products based on late-1980s technology,'\\nsays Mr Lowrie.\\nHe is cautious about raising expectations too soon. 'I don't think anyone\\nreally knows the answer yet - it is very early days. Our view is that we can\\nevolve into other environments because in Case you are maintaining designs\\nnot machine code. But it is few years off.'\\nInformation Architechs, launched in autumn 1990 as a spin-off from British\\nGas, says its future developments in Case are aimed at multiple-platform\\napplications.\\n'We are attracted to the idea that future systems will be based on\\nclient/server databases and local-area networks of personal computers,' says\\nMr Lowrie.\\nMr John Lewis, vice-chairman of IPSYS, UK software engineering company, is\\ncautious and points to IBM's problems with its Systems Application\\nArchitecture (SAA) as an example of the difficulties.\\n'IBM announced SAA four years ago to provide a model for bringing its three\\nmain hardware architectures together. But its hasn't brought out much of it\\nyet. At the same time it has its AIX/Unix developments, which lie outside\\nSAA,' says Mr Lewis.\\nHe sees Unix playing an increased role in software engineering, as a\\ndevelopment environment and as a platform for applications. IPSYS is working\\non Case tools to support Unix alongside proprietary environments.\\n'It is a question of economics. If you set up IBM's AD/Cycle you need an\\nexpensive dedicated mainframe and PS/2 for every programmer. The cost is\\nbetween Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m. With Unix workstations you can set up an\\nequivalent system for about Pounds 1.5m and get far more power for your\\nmoney,' he says.\\nOracle says it has plans to extend its Case products so they can produce\\napplications for multi-vendor networks. At the end of this month, Oracle\\nwill announce a new generation of Case products which will allow designers\\nto specify the characteristics of the target environment and customise the\\nsystem.\\nThis Oracle says, has implications for users. The company intends to include\\nmore features which let the user extend the system and define new objects.\\nThe company anticipates that within the next five years the distinction\\nbetween the development of a system and its live running will disappear.\\nThis is a little optimistic.

So, a map referenced by, say, a\\npostcode could be called up on screen, and depending on the information\\nrequired, be marked differently.\\n'Thus the housing department could ask for all empty council property to be\\ndisplayed, highways for all traffic light systems, and social services for\\nall registered child-minders,' he says.\\nSuch systems, however, require an enormous effort of data input, and Mr\\nCarver notes that from the initial decision to develop a GIS, to final\\nimplementation, normally takes between five and eight years.\\n'It is a massive undertaking, you certainly can't just dip your toe into\\nGIS.

The name\\nfor this is multimedia, and the trademark is MPC - Multimedia Personal\\nComputing.\\nMost computer systems are constrained to store and display information in\\nways more acceptable to machinery than human beings. Text or numbers are the\\nnorm, and, where pictorial information is kept, it is most often in a form\\nmore akin to a cartoon or drawing than to a photograph. The storage of sound\\nfor computerised manipulation is not any more advanced.\\nThere are exceptions to this - a good example being the Domesday Project\\nmachines, which use a BBC micro to access all sorts of geographical and\\ndemographic data from a video disk, for display on a television screen.\\nHowever, in the mainstream of computing such applications are rare. One of\\nthe leading suppliers is VideoLogic, a British company. It provides a board\\nwhich can go into an IBM-compatible PC or Macintosh. It can capture\\ntelevision pictures and sound for editing and inclusion in a presentation\\nalongside other computer data.\\nIntegration of video, audio and conventional data within a data processing\\nsystem is known as multi-media. A multi-media system should enable the user\\nto manipulate and view all such data. He could, for example, press a help\\nbutton, and not only view a manual but bring up an interactive tutorial,\\nwhere a film can be seen and heard of a teacher explaining a topic of\\ninterest.\\nSuch manipulation should be an integral part of the system's capabilities.\\nIn a windowed environment, this would mean that the user would see the film\\nin a window alongside other data, and be able to drag it around the screen\\nor desktop or re-size it.\\nIf such machines were readily available, it is easy to see what their\\npotential would be. Wherever pictorial information was needed it could be\\ninvoked as easily as more normal text. For example, a travel agent could\\nstore the whole of his catalogue of holidays, and then show a customer film\\nof a chosen spot, with appropriate sound track, as well as the normal\\ntextual descriptions.\\nSceptics might argue that all this is more appropriate to killing martians\\non a screen and certainly the games or leisure market is where much of the\\ndevelopment of such systems has taken place. Multi-media enthusiasts,\\nthough, such as Mr Bill Gates of Microsoft, believe that, by the end of the\\n1990s, it will be the norm, and that computer users will expect to be able\\nto deal in all forms of data, and interact with their machines in far more\\nsophisticated ways than they do now.\\n'Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is most readily enjoyed if it is delivered in\\naudio form,' says Mr Gates, in a piece on the subject published in\\nEncyclopaedia Britannica. He has a point.\\nOne wonders in what other form it might be delivered, apart from a printed\\nscore. Obviously, whilst the latter might be useful to a musician, it leaves\\na lot to be desired to the layman. Merely to provide\\nconventionally-displayed computerised information can be just as limiting\\nbecause it does not provide the user with a form of data readily interpreted\\nby the most appropriate human senses for the information under review.\\nMulti-media promises to deliver information in the most appropriate fashion,\\nbut with the same degree of control that you experience with any other\\ncomputerised data. A company might, for example, need a system to enable\\nthem to look at geographical data. You could start by displaying a map. From\\nthere, the user might select a town and look at a picture of the\\narchitecture, or at a list of companies which have offices there, and then\\nat pictures of their products.\\nThose pictures could be revolved or walked around to enable the viewer to\\nsee them from any angle.\\nThey could be accompanied by a spoken sound track describing what is on\\nview. At each stage, the correct medium would be used to communicate the\\ninformation.\\nIt would be easy to dismiss this as just another piece of enthusiastic\\nmarketing, a product looking for a problem. However, that would be to ignore\\nthe way other products have blossomed, and, if not changed the world,\\ncertainly made an impact.\\nSpreadsheets, for example, were originally intended merely to provide a way\\nof doing cash flows, to take the pain out of re-calculating when information\\nchanged, but that in itself could not account for their phenomenal success.\\nUsers have driven that change, and spreadsheets are now embedded within the\\ncorporate culture to such an extent that it is hard to imagine how we could\\nhave managed without them.\\nThe Multi-media PC will not be an end in itself, rather it will provide the\\ntools necessary to create more colourful and informative systems.

       " 'FT911-3912': \"STATISTICALLY speaking, 1990 was a dull year for the UK computer leasing\\nsector.\\nFigures released last month by the Equipment Leasing Association (ELA) show\\na 4 per cent decline to Pounds 2.25bn in computer/office equipment leased by\\nits members, who represent more than 80 per cent of the UK leasing industry.\\nThis is the first decline registered for at least eight years, although 1987\\nproduced only minimal growth following exceptionally strong demand from the\\nfinancial services sector in the preceding year.\\nAccording to Mr Brian Hassell, ELA chairman, 'the decrease in 1990 reflected\\nthe general slowing down in the economy.'\\nIn all other respects, the last 12 months have been extraordinarily\\neventful.\\nStarting last April with the British & Commonwealth subsidiary Atlantic\\nComputers, a succession of independent equipment leasing companies have\\ncollapsed or found themselves in serious difficulties.\\nWith 1,800 employees at the time the administrators were called in, Atlantic\\nwas once the world's third-largest computer leasing specialist.\\nIts customer list in 1983 included the UK Atomic Energy Authority, BAT\\nIndustries, Hanson Trust, ICI and Penguin Books. Its 1988 turnover amounted\\nto Pounds 756.9m.\\nThe most prominent of the subsequent casualties was Blackspur Leasing, the\\nspecialist printing-press leasing company, and ICS, a diversified leasing\\ngroup whose turnover, at its peak, was approximately Pounds 70m.\\nIn addition, the trading position of Capital Computers - another computer\\nleasing specialist - has deteriorated to such an extent since the end of\\nMarch 1990, according to the most recent directors' report filed at\\nCompanies House, that it has been considering 'the sale of all or part of\\nits lease portfolio to third party companies and is also taking steps to\\nreview its position in the leasing market place.'\\nWhile the increasingly recessionary business climate has undoubtedly been\\npartly to blame for the problems that companies have encountered, in certain\\ncases lax management and the questionable structure of the profferred leases\\nalso played a role.\\nAtlantic pioneered an arrangement called the Flexlease which offerred\\ncustomers the ability to take advantage of advancing technology by upgrading\\ntheir computers yet which appeared - at least initially - to be extremely\\nattractively priced.\\nUnfortunately, the Flexlease concept also resulted in the accretion of\\ncontingent liabilities due to the leasing company's commitment under certain\\ncircumstances to make good its customer's payments over the final year or\\nyears of the lease.\\nNot surprisingly, this year's collapses appear to have been the Flexlease's\\ndeath-knell.\\nAccording to Mr Geoff Sewell, director general of the European Computer\\nLeasing & Trading Association (Eclat), 'it is very rare now that anyone\\ntends to look at the Flexlease, although most of the operating leases\\nwritten give customers the option of going back and renegotiating a new\\ndeal.'\\nWith the Department of Trade and Industry investigating Atlantic and the\\nfraud squad in at ICS, the collapses have also left the industry with a\\nsevere image problem.\\nThis can itself have serious knock-on effects.\\nOne of the factors cited by Capital Computers for the deterioration in its\\nperformance was 'the lack of confidence in the leasing market . . .\\nfollowing the failure of the number of leasing companies trading in the UK.'\\nPerhaps the chief beneficiaries of the turmoil in the independent leasing\\nsector have been the computer manufacturers themselves, particularly IBM.\\nMs Carolyn Jacks, director of Grosvenor Consultancy Services, the leasing\\nconsultant, says the situation 'provided a marvellous opportunity for the\\ncomputer manufacturers to market their own lease offering as the safe\\nalternative.'\\nThe annual European computer leasing survey commissioned by Solihull-based\\nEclat underlined 'the increasing dominance of IBM's captive financing\\nsubsidiaries.' More than 70 per cent of the survey's respondents ranked IBM\\namong the top three competitors in the industry, versus 16.2 per cent for\\nComdisco, its nearest rival.\\nA year earlier, IBM had polled 54.9 per cent, versus 27.5 per cent for\\nAtlantic in second place.\\nThe survey also claimed to reveal 'a rising trend of involvement by IBM' in\\nused equipment and buy-back transactions - a field traditionally dominated\\nby the independent leasing companies with their often painstakingly acquired\\nexpertise in the market for second-hand computer equipment.\\nThough competition remains intense, the pressures being brought to bear on\\nthe independents are now prompting expressions of mild concern from some\\nindustry observers.\\nMr Sewell says: 'Few people can specify five years ahead the equipment that\\nwill meet their needs.\\n'The independent sector gives them the option of mixing and matching to meet\\ntheir technical requirements. Without them we would be back to the original\\nposition at the end of the 1970s where the only alternatives available were\\nfinance leases.'\\nMr Sewell stresses, however, that 50-60 per cent of the installed computer\\nbase is still leased through independent leasing companies.\\nAccording to Ms Jacks: 'For the manufacturers, leasing is a sales-aid method\\nwhich assists with marketing their new products - they cannot be expected to\\nprovide their customers with the ability to change suppliers readily.'\",\n",

He manages user relations for the\\nEuropean end of Netware Users International (NUI) the 80,000-strong user\\ngroup for Novell's Netware, the world's most popular networking software.\\nLocal area networks (Lans) are on the up and up, and Netware is the code\\nthat binds them together allowing dozens of people to share files and\\nperipherals such as printers. What concerns Mr Douglas is that software\\nsaboteurs are on the loose, networks are their prime target and publishing\\nhouses in Germany are printing their methods.\\n'They publish books that tell you how to plant a virus. You might as well\\nbring out a title on how to make an atom bomb in your living room,' says Mr\\nDouglas. His anger at the virus authors becomes understandable as he details\\nthe precautions NUI and Novell have been forced to take.\\n'Virus attack has been the main issue in the last 12 months, and preventing\\nit is very expensive. A lot of leading companies do not allow employees to\\nuse diskettes at all, so they can't unwittingly introduce a virus into a\\nnetwork. The problem with networks is that they are meant to be open to many\\nusers.'\\nMr Douglas talks of protective shells, software that checks a program every\\ntime it is entered on to the network to make sure the code has not changed.\\nNUI has pressured Novell to improve the security features written into\\nNetware. Since Netware is a computer operating system in its own right it is\\nnot easy for the virus peddlars to get details of its workings.\\nDocumentation is a closely guarded trade secret. But the interface between\\nNetware and the users' floppy disks became a focus for attention.\\n'Novell has now boosted protection for files entered through Netware. I\\nwon't say exactly what they've done, NUI tested the new release by running a\\nvirus specifically designed to attack MoveIl networks,' says Mr Douglas.\\nMetware's extra defences repelled the virus.\\nA successful virus attack can corrupt networked data across a company. 'They\\ncan act in a nasty way. You find all your storage for the last year has\\ngone. Generally the motivation isn't for gain through blackmail, it's just\\nanarchy,' says Mr Douglas. His scorn for the unseen enemy is very real. The\\nother current passion the networking community admits to is economy.\\n'Security and money are the two big concerns at a typical user group\\nmeeting. In the past, networking solutions had to be high-tech and\\nexpensive. Now the emphasis is on cutting costs,' he adds. Mr Douglas reels\\noff the quick fixes users are resorting to. One site has found it can use\\npower lines as a medium for the local area network (Lan) rather than\\nco-axial cable.\\nIf you don't mind the odd hiccup in non-essential data transmission this\\nmakes some sense. 'It's daft but cheap]' is the Douglas verdict.\\nMr Gary Dyson has been in a good position to observe the rise of the Lan. In\\n1985 he broke away from IBM with two colleagues and formed Persona Faculty.\\nThe dual role company selling products (Persona) and training services\\n(Faculty) was started up to exploit networking.\\nIn 1988, Dyson's Pounds 825 a day training courses attracted just 50 end\\nusers. In 1990, 1,500 people signed up to get the most out of their\\nnetworks.\\nTwo factors contributed to this growth says Mr Dyson. The political war over\\nthe management of data, with corporate IT departments reluctant to see too\\nmuch power shipped down to the users, was resolved. The idea of a Lan of PC\\nworkstations has been absorbed into the corporate computing model.\\nInternational standards have moved on, reconciling the IBM sponsored\\nToken-ring with Ethernet, a networking protocol with its roots in the\\nDigital Equipment world.\\n'The user shouldn't have to worry about choosing between them. They both\\noffer adequate performance, says Mr Dyson.' Faculty has ridden out the\\ncollapse in hardware sales.\\n'In these times you can't sell hardware because companies have got enough.\\nBut networking means they can turn their PC resources into a system. You\\nmake the employees more productive. They cope better with fewer people,' he\\nsays.\\nIf the Lan is now an accepted standard, what are the big corporate buyers\\ndoing to squeeze extra value out of it? As is usually the case in the\\ncomputer industry, any vaguely fresh idea is the cue for a crop of\\nbuzzwords.\\nThe Lan world has now spawned groupware. Referred to in the same breath as\\njoint authoring and discussion databases, groupware allows users to pool\\ndocuments across a network.\\nThe secret of the software is to co-ordinate contributions without the user\\nbeing aware of this stage management. Although it is portrayed as structured\\ndiscussion it is probably better compared to the notorious bulletin boards\\nused to disseminate hackers' tips.\\nLotus Notes is one of the pioneering groupware products. Price Waterhouse,\\nmanagement consultants, use it to control activity on the international\\nfront, when consultants work for a common client across national boundaries.\\nMs Susan Challenger, an international marketing manager at Lotus, admits\\nthat Notes may have fuelled the buzzword business.\\n'We're probably to blame, but groupware is a means to exploit network\\nsoftware rather than just sticking a program on a network and sharing it,'\\nshe says.\\nLotus finds that network versions of popular programs now make up as much as\\na third of its sales.\\nMs Challenger confesses that the distinction between the Lan and its less\\nfamous sister the wide area network (Wan) is not something to tax Lotus's\\nnetwork development teams.\\n'When does a Lan become a Wan? I don't know. I prefer to think of everything\\nin Lan terms,' says Ms Challenger.\\nPerhaps a recent Dataquest survey offers the best explanation for the low\\nprofile of Wans. European Lan spending is predicted to grow from Dollars\\n2.6bn in 1989 to Dollars 5bn by 1993. Over the same period Wan spending will\\nincrease by a modest Dollars 100m, from Dollars 400m to Dollars 500m.\\nInterconnection between Lans is proving an attractive alternative to Wans\\nmanaged by expensive mainframes. And LANS are big in Japan.\\nThe high cost of office space in Tokyo forces a rigorous assessment of every\\nsquare foot. Encouraging staff to share peripherals is one way of keeping\\nthe rent in check, with a Lan saving precious space.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3914': \"HEWLETT Packard has an invitation to show off its new Series 700 workstation\\nlater this month at its user societies' annual general meeting.\\nHowever, this arrangement is not quite as cozy as it looks. Mr Steve\\nChatterton, chairman of ADUS UK (the HP Apollo workstation user group) has\\nasked HP's main rivals IBM, DEC, Silicon Graphics and SUN, to bring their\\ntheir top workstations, and to compete in a demanding benchmark test devised\\nby ADUS.\\nHP is confident that it will not be embarrassed in its own backyard - on\\npaper the 700's specification is superior - but there is little doubt that\\nthe move has ruffled HP's feathers, and it is taking the challenge seriously\\n -to the extent that its worldwide workstation manager will attend.\\nThis little drama illustrates the curious mix of cussed independence and\\nmutual self interest that characterises relations between user groups and\\ntheir suppliers.\\nThe fact that user groups exist at all is testament to this ambivalence.\\nFiercely protective of their separateness, yet loyal, and often genuinely\\nproud of their particular affiliation, in the same way that some people are\\nbound to their cars, user groups remain one of the idiosyncrasies of the\\ncomputer business.\\nAt once ginger group, talking shop and social club, historically these\\nassociations were the users' response to the technical complexities of\\ncomputing and the too often dictatorial tendencies of predominantly US-based\\nhardware vendors. They have developed over the last 20 years into sizeable\\norganisation in their own right: the IBM CUA has 1,500 members, and the DEC\\ngroup, DECUS, turns over Pounds 500,000 in the UK annually in spite of\\nadministrative costs donated by DEC.\\nThese national groups are invariably affiliated to larger pan-European or\\ninternational organisations or groups such as the National Computer Users\\nForum (NCUF) the UK user groups' user group.\\nDoes this complex network have anything other than a self-sustaining role?\\nIn particular, when so many of the old loyalties and dependencies between\\nvendor and customer are threatened by open system environments, is their\\nmuch point in vendor specific user groups?\\nThe short answer seems to be yes.\\nFirst, one of the primary functions of these groups is educational. 'They\\nact as a forum for sharing best practice. The IBM CUA serves as a\\npeer-to-peer information exchange both informally and through its extensive\\nseminar programmes. It helps us to avoid re-inventing the wheel,' says Mr\\nMichael Moore, CUA chairman.\\nDECUS's formal mission is similar exchange, both within the group, and\\nbetween the group and DEC, says Mr Steve Dawes, chairman.\\nAs long as computing remains technically difficult, and in the short term at\\nleast it can only get harder in a multi-vendor, open systems world, then the\\nuser groups' basic role seems assured.\\nThe same is true of their place as lobbyists.\\nThis function is increasingly elevated to a formal consultative status. So,\\nfor example, DECUS submits annual System Improvement Requests to the DEC\\nmain board, a list of technology developments derived from polling\\nindividual members worldwide.\\nAt the same time, says Mr Dawes, the UK group is constantly plugging away at\\nlocal issues - anything from invoicing or licensing practice to an upgrade\\npath for companies using non-standard DEC hardware from the long-defunct\\nSystime.\\nNonetheless the prospect of open environments is making its mark.\\nThe fundamental challenge of open systems has prompted a basic restructuring\\nof the ICL CUA, says Mr David Stewart, its chairman.\\nThe 35 erstwhile individual special interest groups under the CUA umbrella,\\nhave set up a policy and review forum to consider, for the first time, their\\ncommon problems, and in particular to clarify a single voice in dealings\\nwith ICL over open system and UNIX issues.\\nMr Stewart argues that the users' voice generally has not been articulate\\nenough to influence open systems standards, and so far suppliers have\\ndominated the debate. He thinks that ICL will be delighted by the CUA's\\ninitiative to define its own coherent set of priorities.\\nSimilarly, Mr Moore and Mr Dawes report that open systems issues are\\nbeginning to preoccupy their respective groups. Yet, paradoxically, they\\nalso comment that IBM and DEC have never been more attentive in their\\ndealings with their users.\\n'IBM is relying more and more on user organisations,' says Mr Moore. Witness\\nthe 50 senior IBM technical staff who attended the CUA's Common Europe\\nConference in Brighton this month, just to listen to users, he comments.\\nSo what is going on?\\nCould it be, the argument goes, that far from undermining these user groups,\\nopen system, multi-vendor environments, could actually stimulate them?\\nUser groups are persuaded that, as customers become more transient, then\\nsuppliers will appreciate just how critical they are in marshalling customer\\nopinion, and ultimately, in keeping their loyalty.\\nDoes this work out?\\nIn part, perhaps. Certainly the days of user coercion are long gone. Mr\\nRichard Owen, HP's workstation marketing manager, who will have to face the\\nADUS challenge, remarks that HP has long been a customer-led company. 'ADUS\\nis one place we can listen to them,' he says.\\nHowever, the rub, Mr Owen argues, is that whilst user groups are peopled by\\ntechnologists - MIS managers and systems administrators - then they will not\\ndrive IT strategy, and in the long term, it is that, rather than the\\npractical consequences of open computing, that will marginalise them.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3915': \"AS the shock waves of fiercer competition and accelerating structural change\\nflow through world computer markets, debate is intensifying on both sides of\\nthe Atlantic about the policy measures needed to stimulate faster innovation\\nin information technology industries.\\nThe debate is broad because the nature of innovation and the ingredients\\nwhich contribute to it are hard to pin down precisely. Most studies identify\\na wide range of contributing factors, including the macro-economic\\nenvironment, industry structure, education and training, management culture\\nand capital markets.\\nMost of these elements, however, respond to policy changes only over the\\nlonger term. Hence the search for faster-acting remedies has frequently\\nfocused on deepening the technology base by stepping up investment in\\nresearch and development and encouraging research collaboration between\\ncompanies and universities.\\nSince the early 1980s, subsidised joint research programmes such as Esprit\\nhave constituted the main thrust of European Community efforts to enhance\\nthe competitiveness of its electronics industry. In the US, there has been a\\ngrowth of industry consortia such as Sematech, the MCC and the SRC.\\nThe trend has been inspired partly by the mounting costs of staying at the\\nforefront of electronic technologies and partly by the widespread belief\\nthat government-orchestrated collaboration has played a decisive role in the\\nrise of Japan's electronics industry.\\nSo far, industry performance has not perceptibly improved. Many larger US\\ncomputer makers, including IBM, are suffering a severe profit squeeze, while\\nin Europe the industry is fighting for survival as heavy losses at companies\\nincluding Philips, Nixdorf and Bull have prompted drastic retrenchment and\\nrestructuring.\\nWhy has the industry failed to respond? One explanation was given in a\\nrecent paper by Dr Brian Oakley, former head of the Alvey programme, a\\nfive-year electronics industry research project launched by the UK\\ngovernment in the mid-1980s.\\nHe says that though Alvey achieved its technical goals, few of the\\nparticipating companies turned the resulting research into successful\\nproducts. That suggests that the weak link in the innovation chain is not a\\nshortage of good technology but companies' failure to exploit it\\ncommercially.\\nA broadly similar conclusion is supported by a number of recent studies of\\ngovernment-sponsored industry collaboration in Japan. These suggest that\\ngovernment schemes played only a minor role, and that the Japanese\\nindustry's strength owes much more to the stimulus of fierce competition on\\nits home market and to the structure and organisation of individual\\ncompanies.\\nIn successful Japanese electronics manufacturers, research and development\\nare much more tightly integrated with production and marketing than in\\nwestern industry. A team approach ensures the rapid feedback of information\\nbetween all concerned - including suppliers and sub-contractors - at every\\nstage of the process.\\nUnlike western companies, which have traditionally viewed innovation as a\\nsequence of separate leaps forward, in Japan it is a continuous process\\nachieved by simultaneous incremental advances across a broad front.\\nTypically, Japanese manufacturers have many more, smaller development\\nprojects under way at once than do their western counterparts.\\nThe benefits of the Japanese system include shorter product development\\ncycles and greater flexibility in responding rapidly to market changes.\\nFurthermore, by spreading their development effort across so many different\\nprojects, Japanese companies are less vulnerable to the consequences of\\nindividual product failures.\\nStung by Japanese competition, many western technology companies are seeking\\nto speed up innovation by attacking barriers between research, product\\ndevelopment and manufacturing. IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Philips and\\nDaimler-Benz have all recently taken steps to strip away layers of\\nbureaucracy which slow down their response time.\\nHowever, turning technology into manufactured products efficiently is only\\none aspect of the challenge facing the computer industry. Indeed, as even\\nJapanese suppliers are discovering, it is no more than a necessary condition\\nfor staying in the race.\\nAs technology becomes ever more mobile, component prices continue to fall\\nand product lives grow shorter, many types of computer hardware are becoming\\nlow-margin commodities. That trend - which is being accelerated by the\\nspread of open systems standards - is compelling manufacturers to seek more\\nof their value-added downstream by competing on functions, services and\\nsoftware.\\nAs this process gathers momentum, the driving force behind the computer\\nindustry's development is shifting from technology push to market pull.\\nIncreasingly, innovation is stimulated by the way in which computer power is\\napplied, rather than by the specifications of the equipment used to deliver\\nit.\\nThat has placed more influence in the hands of users, particularly larger\\nones, and is obliging suppliers to tailor information systems ever more\\nclosely to the organisation and specific requirements of individual\\ncustomers.\\nA number of western manufacturers, such as IBM and ICL, have responded to\\nthat trend by directing more of their marketing effort into alliances with\\npartners which possess intimate knowledge of specific industry sectors.\\nJapanese computer companies are starting to realise that they can no longer\\nrely simply on technical and manufacturing excellence to sustain their\\ngrowth. Fujitsu's recent acquisition of ICL was heavily influenced by the\\nJapanese company's desire to improve its access to European markets and to\\nbenefit from the British company's expertise in systems integration.\\nOver the longer term, this is likely to mean that computer manufacturers'\\ncompetitive performance will depend critically on the sophistication and\\nquality of demand in their main markets. Furthermore, as information\\ntechnology becomes more pervasive and deeply-embedded, the economic benefits\\nit confers will be found increasingly in its application, rather than its\\nproduction.\\nHowever, the heavy preoccupation among western policy makers with technology\\nas the main competitive battlefield suggests that they have still to absorb\\nthe full implications of these trends. If their efforts to strengthen the\\nperformance of the computer industry are to bear fruit, they will almost\\ncertainly need to widen their focus beyond the supply side and place more\\nweight on measures to stimulate vigorous demand.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3916': \"THE prime driving force behind the panoply of developments in computing has\\nbeen the ever-increasing availability of memory. It is considered quite\\nnormal for a portable computer to have more main memory and on-line disk\\nstorage than could have been crammed into a mainframe system 15 or 20 years\\nago.\\nA significant element in such developments has been the fundamental law of\\nsemiconductor manufacturing first postulated by Mr Gordon Moore, chairman of\\nIntel. This states that the number of transistors which can be designed into\\na given circuit area doubles every 18 months.\\nThis law has held true since Intel developed the first semiconductor memory\\nin the late 1960s. This held just 1,024 binary bits, roughly equivalent to\\n20 words of text. In the intervening 20 years, the capacity of a\\nconventional Dynamic Random Access Memory (Dram) has risen to 4 Mbits, the\\nequivalent of about 77,000 words of text.\\nThe next big step, to Drams holding 16 Mbits, will take that figure to about\\n300,000 words per chip.\\nThe availability of this capability to store programs and data has created a\\nlarge demand for it, which in turn has led to a continual stream of new\\nplayers entering the market and, in their turn, dominating it.\\nAt the start it was US manufacturers such as Intel, National Semiconductor,\\nMostek and Motorola. However, in a highly competitive market with high\\ndemand, and with other product lines such as microprocessors to service,\\nthey were soon overtaken by other companies that specialised in memory\\nproduction.\\nThese were the Japanese suppliers that still dominate the semiconductor\\nmemory business, such as Hitachi, NEC and Fujitsu. It is they that have\\ntaken the lead, not only in memory product, but also in research and\\ndevelopment in the area. Few US companies now bother making memory chips at\\nall.\\nBecause of the nature of semiconductor manufacture, where the investment\\nrequired to make devices of this capacity is large whether 1m or 2m are\\nproduced, the volume production skills and benevolent investment climate of\\nJapan was always likely to make those companies significant in the market.\\nSimilar circumstances are leading manufacturers in other Asia Pacific\\ncountries to target the Japanese suppliers.\\nWell-known names from Singaporean, Tiawanese and Korean consumer\\nelectronics, such as Samsung, Goldstar, Daewoo and Hyundai, are established\\nas suppliers of leading edge devices that rival the dominant Japanese for\\ncapacity, quality, quantity and price.\\nThere is a certain irony in this last factor, for they are proving to be\\nhighly price competitive at a time when their presence is creating the\\npotential of an over-supply of components.\\nThis same sequence of events brought the Japanese suppliers to prominence in\\nthe first place when their aggressive pricing on world markets pushed most\\nUS semiconductor manufacturers out of the memory business and prompted the\\nimposition of trade tariffs and sanctions by the US.\\nThe fact that Moore's Law continues to hold true means that it is perfectly\\npossible to predict the future capacity of memory devices, and when they\\nmight appear. Not only brute capacity will feature, for by the turn of the\\ncentury it is confidently predicted that a wide range of special purpose\\nmemory devices will have appeared.\\nFor example, the turn of the century should see a technology capable of\\nproducing 512 Mbit memory chips but there is, according to companies such as\\nFujitsu, a more important market in using some of that potential capacity to\\nproduce other functionality on the same chip.\\nIt could be possible, for example, to provide logic circuitry on a 256 Mbit\\nchip that will allow the memory to be customised to suit the requirements of\\na specific application.\\nFujitsu suggest it would be possible to include several current state of the\\nart 32-bit processors in just one corner of such a memory chip, with other\\nlogic such as analog to digital converters - important for turning\\nreal-world measurements into a form which can be handled by a digital\\ncomputer - also squeezed on to the same device.\\nSuch a memory could have wide-ranging applications in industry, engineering\\nand commerce, simply because it would be re-programmable.\\nAnother area which is expected to see rapid developments is the Flash Eprom,\\na type of Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory which offers high capacity,\\nnon-volatility and a fast re-write capability.\\nWhat this means in practice is that companies such as Intel, which is a\\nleader in this particular technology, can produce memory cards the size of a\\ncredit-card for portable computers and other space/size critical\\napplications that can be written to with applications and data, stored\\nsafely without the need to be electrically refreshed, be read from as often\\nas needed, and be erased and over-written as required.\\nIn all but two important areas, price and capacity, this is an excellent\\nsemiconductor analogy of the magnetic hard disk system. Even the most\\nenthusiastic semiconductor suppliers do not see the technology, which boasts\\n1Mbyte memory cards, taking over from the hard disk in the near or\\nmedium-term future as the prime vehicle for on-line data storage.\\nFor shear on-line, available data storage capacity, the magnetic disk is\\nstill waiting to be beaten. It is also unbeaten on the classic measure of\\nprice per megabyte of storage.\\nThe manufacturers show no signs of giving up such advantages without a\\nfight. Conner Peripherals, the leading US purveyor of small disk systems,\\nhas helped to open up the burgeoning notebook PC market by producing systems\\nusing disks just 2.5 inches in diameter, yet capable of storing more than 20\\nMbytes of data.\\nAt the other extreme, high capacity 5.25 inch disks are being cascaded\\ntogether in desk-side PC systems from the likes of Dell and Compaq to\\nprovide over 1 Gigabyte of capacity - more than many a mainframe system.\\nThe long-standing role of magnetic tape as the medium for storing archive\\ndata is under threat. Variations on the CD-ROM, based on established Compact\\nDisk Technology, are providing much higher capacities in a safer and more\\nusable form. In addition, they are starting to prove an excellent delivery\\nvehicle for comprehensive published data, such as directory information.\\nMost important of all, they open up new markets for companies to publish\\nvital product information such as documentation.

This means that potential users must customise their\\nsystems and develop their own application specific software. Inevitably,\\nthis has limited the market.\\n'The problem is that vendors have been selling the technology as a\\ntechnology, not as a solution to a business problem,' says Mr David Kelly,\\ndocument management systems marketing manager for computer supplier NCR.\\nUsers often end up developing simple, sometimes ineffective systems: 'If you\\nlook at the applications, they are not very sophisticated, nor as widespread\\nas the technology will allow,' he says.\\nImage systems have been developed separately from other business\\napplications. The big banks and insurance companies which have invested in\\nDIP systems have all struggled with the issue of how to integrate their\\nimage applications with their traditional business applications.\\nThe technical problems of putting effective image systems together have been\\ncompounded by a simple one of scale: a normal A4 page of wordprocessor text\\ntakes up about 1 kilobyte of computer memory or disk space, but a scanned A4\\npage can take up as much as 30K to 80K of memory (depending on complexity).\\nSuch large volumes of information can quickly fill up magnetic disks and\\nclog up communications networks.\\nEach of these obstacles is now being tackled and to a large extent overcome.\\nThe cost of raw computer power has fallen rapidly over 10 years, while\\noptical disk technology has solved the storage problem: each compact disk\\ncan store thousands of scanned images.\\nCompression techniques, high-speed local area networks and high band width\\ncommunication lines have solved the document distribution problem and now\\nmake it feasible for scanned images to be distributed across large\\ncompanies.\\nScanners have improved and fallen in price, with the Japanese taking a\\ngrowing market share. At the top end, specialist scanners for reading\\ncheques can read up to 400,000 documents a day, some reading both sides.\\nFull colour scanners, although still expensive, are also finding their way\\ninto some desk top publishing applications.\\nThe biggest market for document scanners is at the low end, where quality is\\nimproving and costs are falling. Kurzweil, a leading supplier, has a system\\nin the Pounds 15,000 bracket which can read up to 50 pages a minute at a\\nhigh-quality 400 dots-per-inch resolution.\\nHand-held scanners for attaching to personal computers are available for a\\nfew hundred pounds. Last year, an international group called the Scanner\\nProgrammers Interface Association announced they were developing\\ninternational standards to make it far easier to use scanners with simple\\noffice software programs.\\nUntil now, fax machines, photocopiers and computer-attached scanners have\\nbeen separate devices serving separate purposes. But some suppliers believe\\nthat eventually the use of 'scan servers' will become widespread: documents\\nwill be scanned once and automatically indexed, after which any user on an\\noffice network can make copies, distribute them electronically, or\\nmanipulate them on-screen.\\nXerox, developer of the photocopier and the inventor of the windows\\ngraphical user interfaces used by Apple and others, is leading the way. It\\nannounced in October 1990 that in the US the Xerox Docutech Production\\nPublisher 'will ignite a revolution as profound as the introduction of the\\nfirst plain paper copier in 1959'. The system can be used to scan colour\\nimages from paper, manipulate them on-screen using 'cut and paste'\\ntechniques, and print up to 135 high quality copies a minute. But it is not\\ncheap: an initial configuration costs in the region of Dollars 220,000.\\nThe most impressive examples of document image processing in use can be seen\\nin the financial sector, where the big paper-bound institutions have\\ndeveloped corporate-sized systems. Norwich Union, for example, recently\\nrevealed its new mainframe-based insurance claims handling system, based on\\nIBM's Imageplus system. Eventually, it intends to deliver document images to\\nas many 10,000 terminals throughout the organisation.\\nThe benefits of image processing can be seen at Royal Life, part of the\\nRoyal Insurance Group. It installed an Olivetti Filenet document image\\nprocessing system in late 1989 to store copies of its pension plan\\ndocuments. It has spent a bout Pounds 500,000 on the computer hardware and\\nabout Pounds 300,000 on software.\\nThe Filenet system is being used to hold about 180,000 executive pension\\nplan documents which have been scanned in and are then stored on video disks\\nwhich can hold up to 40,000 A4 pages. The Filenet scanner is theoretically\\ncapable of scanning 40,000 A4 pages a day; Royal Life uses it to process\\n3,000 a day (it is not an automatic process; each document needs to be\\nscanned, checked and indexed in a process which takes about 20 minutes per\\npage).\\nBefore the system was installed, the paper files were kept in vast archives.\\nExisting policies took several days to retrieve manually and new policies\\ntook between eight and 30 days to process. Financial intermediaries\\nfrequently complained about the long delays.\\nNow, new policies can be processed within 24 hours, while checking on\\nexisting policies is immediate. 'We can get any A4 page off the system in\\nbetween two and 17 1/2 seconds,' says Mr Alex Littlejohn, Royal Life's\\ncustomer service manager.\\nThe fastest growth in demand for image processing applications is being seen\\nat companies such as Royal Life, where there is a serious paper storage and\\nmanagement problem which is affecting business efficiency. According to\\nmarket researchers Ovum, the price of a typical multi-user DIP system will\\nfall from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 400,000 over the next four years,\\nattracting thousands of new customers.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3918': \"WHEN computer systems were monolithic machines in air-cooled offices, locked\\naway from most of the employees, the security of the data was relatively\\neasy to guarantee. But the pervasiveness of personal computing and computer\\nnetworking now means that almost every employee in many large companies has\\naccess to the main computer. Ensuring the data is not maliciously altered or\\nmisappropriated is therefore increasingly difficult to achieve.\\nMost organisations are beginning to realise the importance of sound security\\nmeasures. According to accountants Price Waterhouse, security accounts for 9\\nper cent of expenditure on new computer systems, up from 5 per cent, five\\nyears ago. Today only 5 per cent of companies spend nothing on it compared\\nto 25 per cent in the mid-1980s.\\nOne difficulty for commercial organisations is that there is no single\\nsource of risk: instead companies have to secure what is known as the 'CIA'\\nof computer data:\\n'Confidentiality' - so that only those who are authorised to see or alter\\nthe information can do so.\\n'Integrity' - to ensure the information is not changed.\\n'Availability' - to guarantee the computer is operating correctly when\\nrequired.\\nOne of the biggest threats to companies is the computer virus, says Mr Peter\\nJenner, business manager of PA Consulting's security consultancy centre. In\\nthe UK, both Rolls-Royce and British Rail, for example, have experienced\\nviruses this year.\\nViruses, computer codes which replicate themselves from one computer to\\nanother and destroy the integrity of the data, come in a wide variety of\\nforms, many with exotic names. With the 'cascade' virus, for example, all\\nthe characters fall from the top of the screen into a pile at the bottom.\\nWhile with the 'Italian' virus a ping-pong ball bounces across the computer\\nscreen.\\nVirus checking software is available from companies such as Sophos, of\\nAbingdon, SS International, of Berkhamsted, and International Data Security,\\nof London. It works by checking for the individual pattern that every virus\\nleaves in the program.\\nHowever, virus developers see the increasing sophistication of anti-virus\\nsoftware as a challenge to develop ever more complex viruses, says Mr Chris\\nFrost, senior manager in the European data security division of Price\\nWaterhouse, making it increasingly difficult to spot the interloper. The\\nlatest stealth viruses change their identification code every time the\\nprogram is loaded - so the detection system cannot look for a specific\\nstring of code.\\nOther viruses are armoured to prevent detection. When they latch on to a\\nprogram they encrypt it entirely, making it difficult for the scanning\\nsoftware to detect where the virus code begins and ends. Other viruses have\\neven been developed that remove themselves altogether from the program when\\nthe detection software is run.\\nAs often as not, viruses are introduced into a company by an employee\\nbringing in his or her own floppy disk to play computer games at lunchtime.\\nFar more sinister is the hacker who breaks into the computer system by\\nimitating the sign-on procedure of a company employee - by using his or her\\ncomputer password.\\nThe biggest problem with computer passwords is that employees often do not\\ntake them seriously - they are likely to use the name of their spouse,\\nchildren or pet dog as the password, all of which can be easily guessed by\\nthe would-be hacker. Or they use series of easily guessed numbers, or even\\nthe word 'password' itself.\\nTo overcome this the latest software packages contain lists of unacceptable\\npasswords - up to 20,000 words of them in some cases. More secure means of\\npreventing unauthorised access to computer systems are on the market or\\nunder development. One is biometric devices, such as retina scanners,\\nthumbprint recognition machines and sign-on machines where users have to\\nsign their name.\\nWhile somebody can change their password into a computer system easily\\nenough, it is impossible to change a thumb print, or a retina, but this can\\nbring drawbacks. Once a hacker has taken a thumbprint, for example, they can\\ngain access to the computer system repeatedly without anyone noticing.\\nMore complex are combinations of hardware and software. Dynamic password\\ntokens, for example, use devices about the size of a credit card which\\nproduce a new numeric password every few seconds. This change is controlled\\nby an algorithm, or mathematical formula, which is synchronised with the\\nmainframe's software. To use the system the user types in a name and\\npassword, and then types in the password that is displayed at that moment on\\nthe token.\\nOnce a hacker gets into a computer system the results can be horrendous. The\\nwidespread use of computer systems in financial applications - payroll,\\nfunds transfer or bill payment - has offered organised crime a lucrative\\nopportunity for replacing the security van robbery with split-second\\nelectronic fraud.\\nMost frauds are discovered by regular checks, but expert computer systems\\nare helping to minimise the cost of these. In the case of a bank, for\\nexample, the expert system would be programmed to know that a Pounds 1,000\\ntransaction at an exclusive clothes shop would probably be genuine, whereas\\na transaction of the same amount from the local supermarket would not.\\nThere is a growing awareness among computer companies that their operating\\nsystems software must be made more difficult to crack. ICL, for example, now\\noffers a high-security version of its VME operating system for commercial\\nuse which incorporates mandatory controls: files cannot be moved from one\\nsection of the computer to another - from accounts, say, to manufacturing.\\nSuch security measures have also been adopted for the Unix operating system,\\nwith the latest version of Posix - which interfaces between Unix and the\\napplications software - having the capability to create these mandatory\\ncontrols.\\nLast but not least, computer manufacturers and consultants are selling their\\nwares as disaster recovery companies. Back-up sites and mobile computer\\nunits are there to ensure that even if your computer room is flooded or\\nstruck by lightning, your business is not destroyed as well.\",\n",

       " 'FT911-3920': \"REVERSE engineering, the practice of unravelling a competitor's product to\\nlearn how it works in order either to emulate it or to attach proprietary\\nequipment, achieved unlikely political notoriety last year after a European\\nCommission draft directive designed to protect software makers unleashed one\\nof the fiercest bouts of lobbying ever witnessed in Brussels or Strasbourg.\\nThe purpose of the draft directive was both simple and honourable; to\\nprotect the creators and suppliers of personal computer software who are\\nbeing cheated annually of about Pounds 3bn in Europe through unauthorised\\ncopying of their products.\\nThe idea was to eliminate existing disparities between the copyright\\nprotection systems for software in the member states as part of the\\nCommission's general plans for the harmonisation of EC law for 1992.\\nAs such, it was supported to the hilt by organisations such as the Business\\nSoftware Alliance, the Software Publishers Association, and the Federation\\nAgainst Software Theft.\\nThe Business Software Alliance, established by six of the world's leading PC\\nsoftware suppliers - Aldus (desk top publishing) Ashton Tate (database)\\nAutodesk (computer aided draughting) Lotus (spreadsheets) Microsoft\\n(operating systems) and Wordperfect (word processing), has taken a leading\\nrole in initiating legal proceedings against companies it believes guilty of\\nsoftware theft.\\nHowever, what turned a commonsense measure designed to protect software\\ncompanies in a uniform manner across Europe into a political hot potato was\\nthe fine detail in the draft. Computer manufacturers realised quickly that\\nthe provisions of the directive would specifically forbid unauthorised\\nreverse engineering and in doing so, hamper their efforts to compete with\\nthe leaders of the industry such as International Business Machines (IBM)\\nand Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).\\nA campaign led by the hastily formed European Committee for Interoperable\\nSystems (ECIS), to persuade members of the European parliament and the\\nCommission to modify the directive was immediately initiated.\\nThe software suppliers, together with IBM and DEC who saw the opportunity\\nlegally to forbid Japanese manufacturers access to their technology, took\\nthe opposite line and for some months the two lobbies fought a fierce war of\\nwords.\\nIt was not surprising that the Commission's draftsmen failed to anticipate\\nthe scale of the row they were to precipitate. Reverse engineering, while\\nsimple in concept is complex in detail and the extent to which it is used is\\nessential. Furthermore, its use in the computer industry is rarely\\nappreciated by outsiders.\\nIt is an easy concept to understand in conventional engineering. Automobile\\nmanufacturers routinely take their competitor's vehicles apart to see what\\nmakes them tick. So what is reverse engineering in computer software?\\nIt is software archaeology, according to Mr Gilles Lafue, a software\\nspecialist with Andersen Consulting. 'It consists of extracting the\\nsoftware's functionality (what the software does) and the design (how it\\ndoes it) by analysing the software's implementation - that is, programming\\ncode, data structures, files and databases.'\\nIt is necessary because of the dominant position of a small number of\\nmanufacturers who are able to set de facto standards for data processing\\nsystems. That means essentially IBM and DEC. Other manufacturers must so\\ndesign their equipment that it can be connected to IBM's or DEC's if they\\nare to have a share of the data processing cake. To do so, they have to\\nunderstand the design of the connection, or interface, in great detail.\\nThat knowledge can be acquired either directly from IBM or DEC - leaving the\\ncompetitor at the mercy of the industry leaders - or it can obtained by\\nreverse engineering with or without their permission.\\nOf course, reverse engineering can be used to create a competitive product\\nthrough copying or improving on the original which is why software makers\\nare keen to have it banned. Many of the best software innovations are not\\npatented but simply hidden away in thousands of lines of computer code to\\nprevent copying; legal reverse engineering, the software specialists\\ncomplain, would be tantamount to a plagiarist's charter.\\nIt was not simply hardware manufacturers and software houses who were upset.\\nEurope's computer users realised their ability to carry out essential\\nmaintenance on their software would be hindered by the directive.\\n(Maintenance, in the software business, means modifying and extending\\nexisting programs rather than repair.)\\nA compromise position was reached in December last year when a version of\\nthe directive was agreed in Brussels which provided for:\\nClassification of software as literary works\\nA definition of originality\\nA common term of protection in accordance with the Berne Convention\\nLegal reverse engineering in limited circumstances.\\nThese circumstances are when the retrieval of information is confined to the\\nparts of the original program necessary for inter-operability, when the\\ninformation retrieved is not communicated to third parties except to the\\nextent necessary for the operation of the new program and the information\\nretrieved is not used to create or market a program that infringes a\\ncopyright in the original program.\\nThe compromise proved broadly satisfactory to the hardware manufacturers and\\nto the software suppliers. However, the issue has continued to spark\\ncontroversy.\\nEarlier this month, the European parliament's committee on Legal Affairs and\\nCitizen's Rights proposed 11 amendments to the draft directive which clarify\\nthe scope of the directive for research and analysis and the status of\\ninterfaces between hardware and software under copyright law.\\nIt has resulted in a new round of lobbying with ECIS in the forefront of a\\ncampaign to persuade MEPs to vote in favour of most of the amendments.\\nMeanwhile, the Business Software Alliance which represents over 800\\npublishers of PC software, has decided it is time to call a halt.\\nIn an open letter to the legal affair committee earlier in the year it said:\\n'After over a year of extended lobbying, it was finally possible last\\nDecember to reach a compromise that virtually the whole computer industry\\ncould accept. We believe that it is now time to include all of the lobbying\\nand political debate and let the industry get back to what it does best -\\nproducing hardware and software - under the terms of this compromise'.\",\n",

Some, such as\\nDigital Equipment (DEC), have arguably come to it somewhat later than\\nothers, while IBM is at last showing some signs that is taking the subject\\nseriously.\\nThe operating system is starting to have an impact on the way mid-range\\nsystems are designed and built.

The MIPS-based DEC Station\\nsystems are still largely at the low-end of the company's product range, but\\nMIPS has a new, more powerful 64-bit processor on the drawing board, which\\nis likely to form the basis of any successor to DEC's successful VAX\\nminicomputer architecture.\\nThese chips lie at the heart of the new consortium of leading hardware and\\nsoftware companies, known both as the 'Gibraltar Group' and the Advanced\\nComputing Environment (ACE) group, which is aiming to build a new industry\\nstandard for both the lower reaches of mid-range systems and workstations.\\nMost estimates suggest that the first new machines built to this standard\\nwill not appear for three years.\\nEvidence to bear this out comes indirectly from DEC, which is pressurising\\nits existing VAX users into updating their applications code to take\\nadvantage of future RISC systems within three years, otherwise they will be\\neffectively locked out of future open systems developments. The company\\nplans to shift to RISC-based systems and away from the VAX architecture in\\nthe long term.\\nPrime targets for the ACE group are Sun Microsystems, which claims to own\\nabout 60 per cent of the workstation and low-end mid-range market place, and\\na newly reinvigorated IBM, which has scored some significant recent\\nsuccesses with its own RISC-based machines, the RS/6000 range.\\nSun Microsystems is fast becoming an important player in the mid-range\\nmarket, not only for its own systems but also for its SPARC RISC-chip set,\\nwhich is being aggressively marketed to other systems vendors. Several names\\nin the mid-range market, with UK's ICL leading the way, have signed up to\\nuse the SPARC chip set and have established their own systems in the market\\nplace. The chip set offers systems builders a scalable platform, allowing\\nthem to develop machines that range from 12 mips (million instructions per\\nsecond) workstations to 100 mips superminicomputers, all running the same\\noperating system and applications software.\\nStretching from the desktop workstation through to large corporate server\\nsystems, the IBM RS/6000 has ruffled some feathers among established Unix\\nmid-range suppliers by winning an order for 2,500 systems from Barclays\\nBank. This cuts across the standard industry perception that IBM only pays\\nlip-service to Unix, and even then takes an alternative stance by having its\\nown version of the system, a extensively re-engineered superset of the Unix\\nstandard called AIX.\\nFrom the company's early efforts in the RISC-based workstation and mid-range\\nmarkets with the 6150, which were generally considered to be down on\\nperformance and up on price in comparison with the competition, the\\ncompletely re-worked RS/6000 series looks like making a success of itself.\\nThis, in turn, may prompt IBM to take an even more positive stance about it,\\nrather than always managing to give the impression that it is something of\\nan afterthought to other, more strategic product families.\\nIn this context, the company's main mid-range offering is the AS/400 family.\\nThough by most other manufacturer's standards it would be considered a large\\nsuccess, sales of these machines have generally been considered as somewhat\\ndisappointing. It has largely been seen as the replacement for the company's\\nold System 3/X line of minicomputers which have a good, if stolid reputation\\nin the traditional small and medium-sized business market.\\nSystem 3X replacement sales have been good for the AS/400, but its\\npenetration into new markets, especially those dominated by DEC with its VAX\\nsystems, has not been excessive.\\nThe machine has been plagued recently with technical problems, particularly\\nin the area of disk storage. It has been found that disk drives for the\\nmachine are suffering from excessive vibration which causes disk crashes and\\nconsequent failure of the system. What has made this worse is the fact that\\nthe system software is spread across all drives used on an AS/400, which\\nmeans they all must work for the system to work.\\nAS/400 users are subject to the changing pricing policies that can come with\\nsuch proprietary systems. Recent changes in IBM's software pricing for this\\nmachine have left users that upgrade their existing systems facing a 50 per\\ncent jump in software costs for enhanced code that had previously been free.\\nOne growing trend in the mid-range market is towards multiprocessor systems\\nbuilt around common devices such as the Intel i486 processor. One of the\\nleading contenders, Sequent, has systems available using as many as 18 of\\nthese devices, offering a capability of servicing up to 500 users.\\nNCR has recently announced systems using a similar architecture which, like\\nthe Sequent system, runs Unix. Once again, the basis of the trend is towards\\nscale in both the hardware architecture and the applications software to\\ngive mid-range users maximum flexibility.\\nSuch systems go some way towards meeting the growing need for fault\\ntolerance by the simple expedient of using a lot of processors. This is only\\na partial solution, however, and rarely satisfies those users with\\nbusiness-critical applications that demand the maximum in reliability.\\nThat market place remains the domain of two main contenders, Stratus\\nComputers and, the market leader, Tandem. The latter's Integrity S2 machines\\nuse multiple processors, but instead of tasks being shared out among a\\nnumber of small units, these use large processors to run the applications\\ntogether, monitoring each other's output and voting between them to discover\\nand isolate faults.\",\n",

This is the\\nconcept that, as technology allows the same performance to be packed into an\\never-smaller physical size, so the need for the big boxes will diminish to\\nan eventual vanishing point of economic non-viability.\\nThe evidence is now starting to point away from this inevitability. Instead,\\nthe term 'right-sizing' is starting to gain credence. With that credence\\ncomes an appreciation that the mainframe will continue to have an important\\nrole. What is more the corollary of downsizing, that the technology will be\\nexploited to add more power and performance to a system of any given\\nphysical size and price, will provide continued justification for that role.\\nRight-sizing takes as its basis the fact that different types of\\napplications in information management require different systems\\narchitectures to run them most efficiently. Therefore, while it is far more\\nsensible to run a highly user-interactive mix of spreadsheeting, graphics\\nand text report writing applications together on a PC, the same platform is\\ntotally inadequate as the host of a large, on-line transaction processing\\nsystem.\\nHere, there is really no alternative to a large mainframe installation and\\nan extensive disk farm of on-line data storage. As such on-line transactions\\nprocessing (OLTP) systems are the life-blood of most large corporations,\\nsuch as the financial institutions, there is unlikely to be any significant\\nreduction in either the role of or demand for mainframe systems.\\nThe main differentiator that defines mainframes, minicomputers and\\nworkstations/PCs, is the relationship between an application's data and\\nfunctionality.\\nAn application that is data-rich but functionally poor, such as OLTP or\\nlarge database management, is ideally suited to a mainframe solution.\\nApplications with the inverse ratio suit the workstation/PC, while the\\nminicomputer matches applications which require a reasonable mix of these\\ntwo elements.\\nThe fact that there is still very much a role for mainframes has not meant a\\nhealthy flow of business for the manufacturers.

Then, sales of the most powerful, six processor systems, the ES/9000\\nModel 900, and the top of the entry-level machines, Models 330 and 340, rose\\nsharply.\\nThis looks as though it has been a temporary excursion, and that sales will\\ncontinue slowly. As well as the problems of recession, the machines mark a\\nfairly radical step function both in performance and compatibility with the\\nthe existing IBM mainframe product family, the 370 Series.\\nThere are only a limited number of bridges between the two families, and\\nusers of 370 series machines may first have to upgrade their existing\\nsystems to one of the configurations at which a transition to the equivalent\\nES/9000 can be made. There have also been some missed compatibility\\nopportunities in fairly obvious, even rather silly areas.\\nFor example, the upper range of the ES/9000 series is water-cooled, as are\\nthe 370 series machines, yet they use different diameter piping to supply\\nthe coolant.\\nIn spite of the continued reliance on proprietary architectures and\\noperating systems from the mainframe suppliers, there are signs that open\\nsystems concepts are now penetrating deeply.\\nAmdahl, for example, is still the only mainframe supplier to offer an\\nimplementation of Unix as a native operating system on its machines. Others,\\nincluding IBM, only offer it as a guest running under the proprietary\\noperating system.\\nUnix on the mainframe has been a slow starter, but some users see it as a\\nway out of being locked in to not only proprietary systems, but the pricing\\nthat can go with them. It offers opportunities in providing more coherent\\ncommunications between different hardware platforms, a fundamental element\\nof open systems, if they are all running broadly the same operating system.\\nIf Unix does become more prominent on mainframe systems, it offers the\\nchance of greater freedom for the IBM plug compatible systems manufacturers,\\nwhich include the likes of Amdahl and Fujitsu.\\nThese have built their businesses on making hardware that runs IBM software\\nbut is cheaper and/or more readily available than IBM kit. Any significant\\nswitch to Unix in the market could allow both them and the users a wider,\\nmore competitive choice of sources for applications software. It could\\nreverse the current situation and allow a native Unix to act as host to a\\nmanufacturer's existing proprietary operating system. This would provide\\ncurrent users of proprietary systems with continuity as well as broadening\\nthe choice of upgrade path.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3923': \"THE trend to downsizing where applications previously carried out on a\\nmainframe can now often be done on a mini; and the power that one expected\\nfrom a mini now being available in today's top of the range PCs is having a\\nprofound effect on the market for printers.\\nOn the one hand, advanced features and performance is required and yet, at\\nthe same time, the market will not bear prices which appear to be out of all\\nrelationship with the falling prices of the PCs to which the devices will be\\nconnected.\\nSome users want colour, others need improved quality such as higher\\nresolution (in dots per inch) while many departments need to handle\\nmulti-part forms. Furthermore, a growing proportion of users need a graphics\\ncapability to handle a variety of text fonts and sizes as well as charts and\\nmore complex images. This is a facility which is widely available,\\nespecially in the non-impact page printers.\\nOne long-felt business need is colour to enable, for example, profits/losses\\nto be more readily seen in a spreadsheet. The simplest way of achieving this\\nis to use a printer with a two-colour ribbon as was used in a manual\\ntypewriter. Where this would be too slow, colour ink jet and thermal\\ntransfer printers come into their own.\\n'The market for high quality colour printers is one which, until now, has\\nbeen supplied with high priced machines,' says Mr Richard Bright of\\nMannesmann Tally, printer manufacturer. 'By introducing a sub-Pounds 2,000\\nthermal transfer page printer we have significantly reduced the cost of\\ncolour page printing, without sacrificing print quality. What was a\\nspecialist piece of equipment is now available to general business users.'\\nAccording to BIS CAP International the European colour printer market is set\\nto expand from 170,000 units in 1990 to 500,000 in 1994 and will be worth\\nabout Dollars 1.3bn by 1994. The UK printer market is likely to grow from\\n45,000 units in 1990 to 180,000 in 1994. It will be worth Dollars 400m by\\n1994.\\nWhile, no doubt, some of this growth will come from normal business users, a\\ngrowing proportion will be in computer-aided design (CAD) and desktop\\npublishing where users will be able to get a colour representation of their\\ndocuments before going out to print in high volume.\\nThe widely-used laser printer with its 300 x 300 dots per inch (DPI)\\nresolution is frequently not considered adequate for DTP. Hence, once the\\nwork has been completed on the Macintosh (or PC), the actual camera-ready\\nartwork is prepared on a higher resolution printer often of more than 1,000\\nDPI.\\nBridging the two markets is the Qume CrystalPrint Express. Not only does\\nthis 12 page per minute (appreciably faster than the average laser printer)\\nprovide 600 x 300 resolution which is adequate for many applications it\\nincorporates a number of interfaces (including AppleTalk) and emulations\\nwhich together offer the compatibility required when the printer is a\\n'shared resource' on a local area network (LAN).\\nAlso vying for this market are other versatile printers such as the Kodak\\nEktaplus 7016 and the HP Laserjet III Si from Hewlett-Packard, the market\\nleader in the non-impact market. While both of these are 16 pages per minute\\n(PPM) the former incorporates a 6 PPM photocopier 'designed for those simple\\none or two copies tasks common in the busy office environment thus\\nincreasing productivity by reducing waiting time at the photocopier'.\\nThe latter, using HP's resolution enhancement technology together with\\nmicrofine toner, is claimed to give resolution akin to that of a 600 DPI\\nprinter. One of its options is that it can have a direct high-speed\\nconnection to a LAN, such as Novell, so obviating the need for a separate PC\\nas a printer-server. This is far more cost-effective than with many\\nnetworked printers.\\nLaser and ink jet printers are 'non-impact' unlike dot-matrix machines which\\ntend to have a low-tech image and are often derided for their lower quality\\nand high noise level. In spite of this they are the workhorses of industry\\nand commerce and are able to handle multi-part forms which the other\\ntechnologies cannot handle. According to Romtec, the market analyst, for\\nthose reasons plus cost they still account for 57 per cent of the UK market\\nwith laser and inkjet holding for 27 and 11.7 per cent respectively.\\nFor example, Epson which tends to be identified as the world's predominant\\nsupplier of dot matrix printers (in spite of claiming to take a growing\\nshare of the non-impact market) produces both general purpose and\\nspecialised products. A good example of the latter is its DFX-1000. This is\\na heavy duty system printer which will handle high-speed printing of\\nmulti-part forms at up to 300 lines per minute making it, they believe, the\\nfastest serial impact printer in the world.\\nHowever, Romtec also reports that, during the fourth quarter of 1990, Epson\\nand Hewlett-Packard had 29.2 and 23.6 per cent respectively of the printer\\nsales (in units) to business end users via dealers, distributors. Retailers\\ndirect sales by the manufacturers only accounted for a very small\\nproportion. But, as the Epson business is largely in the lower-cost dot\\nmatrix market, the value of HP's sales is higher.\\nThe dot matrix market is facing tough competition - especially from inkjet\\nprinters - as users become more conscience of the image that their own\\nprinted output creates.\\nMs Nicky Ayre, product manager at HP says the Deskjet HP DJ500 is 'the\\nbetter alternative to the dot matrix and that there is no longer a\\nprice-penalty to pay for higher quality'. She says HP is focusing on the\\nhigher quality that is being expected by the discerning users. The HP DJ500\\nis ideal as a personal printer where the requirement is for about 50 pages\\nper day and is increasingly being installed in people's homes.\\nIt can be seen that there is no universal requirement. As a result, the\\nvariety of printers continues to grow. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find\\nthe collection of features that are needed at an affordable price.\",\n",

By contrast, Mr Tom Beaver,\\nvice-president of Motorola, positively insists on his organisation being\\ncalled a computer company.\\nRegardless of how they prefer to be styled, both of these leading US\\nsemiconductor manufacturers now make products which used to be made by\\ncomputer companies. As computer companies concentrate on profitable\\nactivities such as software and systems integration, semiconductor companies\\nsuch as Intel and Motorola are spending more of their time manufacturing\\ncomputers.\\nTen years ago, the computer companies simply provided customers with their\\ncomputers. Now the task of traditional computer companies has shifted, says\\nMr Giroud. 'The end user is asking for more software, more assistance, more\\ntraining,' he says.\\nAs computer companies have moved away from their older manufacturing role,\\nIntel, the world's leading manufacturer of microprocessors, has moved in.\\n'We are doing what an ICL or a Nixdorf was doing 10 years ago,' Mr Giroud\\nsays. 'We are making the central processing unit that ICL used to make 10\\nyears ago.'\\nThe reason he insists on Intel not being called a computer company is that\\nit does not deal directly with the end users of computers. 'A computer\\ncompany is a company that sells solutions to the end user. We supply\\nhardware to the system integrators. They supply the technology to the end\\nuser, combined with the software. We are not in competition with Compaq,\\nHewlett-Packard or IBM.'\\nMotorola, America's biggest semiconductor maker, sees itself as being more\\ndirectly involved in the computer industry. Mr Beaver says the company\\nregards itself as a manufacturer of standard computers, along with their\\noperating software. The only area in which Motorola is not involved is in\\nthe provision of applications software.\\nFive years ago Motorola established a separate computer division, which Mr\\nBeaver heads. One of the reasons why Motorola wanted to move more decisively\\ninto computer manufacture was to help influence the debate over common\\noperating standards.\\nThe computer industry worldwide has seen a move away from computers which\\nare unable to communicate with those provided by other manufacturers.\\nCustomers are increasingly insisting on common standards or open systems.\\nThey are demanding that different manufacturers provide computers that can\\ntalk to one another. Motorola makes computers which use A T & T's Unix\\noperating system.\\nThe move from proprietary to open systems provided Motorola with what it saw\\nas a commercial opportunity.\\n'We saw a lot of computer companies struggling through the transition from\\nproprietary to open systems. We saw a lot of them deciding to become niche\\ncompanies, specialising in banking, insurance, what have you. They're\\nletting someone else build the hardware. We saw that as an opportunity\\nbecause our corporation is good at competing in commodity products. We make\\ncomputers as a commodity item,' says Mr Beaver.\\nMr Beaver says he sees the world computer industry today as being divided\\ninto three groups. The first consists of companies providing a mixture of\\ncomputers adhering to both their own and to common operating standards. He\\nsays the American companies IBM, DEC, Unisys and Hewlett-Packard belong in\\nthis category, along with Siemens of Germany.\\nThe second group consists of companies providing computer systems to clients\\nin particular fields, such as banking or law, and contracting out much of\\nthe hardware manufacture. He puts Wang of the US, Olivetti of Italy, Philips\\nof the Netherlands and Nixdorf of Germany (now part of Siemens) in this\\ngroup.\\nThe third group consists of companies providing products for the open\\nsystems market. NCR, Intel, A T & T, Sun Microsystems and Compaq - all of\\nthe US - fall into this category, as do most of the Japanese computer\\ncompanies. So, he says, does Motorola. Participating in a commodity market,\\nhe says, these companies have to sell computers on the basis of price and\\nperformance.\\nThe move by many computer companies away from manufacturing is not the only\\nreason that some chip companies have become computer manufacturers. Mr\\nGiroud points out that technological developments mean that computers use\\nfewer and fewer chips.\\n'At the moment, you take two chips from Intel, eight chips from someone\\nelse, add the memory, and you have a personal computer. In 1984 or 1985, you\\nneeded 170 chips plus the memory to make a computer. In 1993, the 10 chips\\nplus the memory you need today will become one chip plus the memory,' Mr\\nGiroud says.\\nAs the number of chips used in computers shrinks, semiconductor makers\\neffectively become computer manufacturers. 'What we are doing is we are\\nputting a PC on a chip,' Mr Giroud says. 'The chips we are designing now\\nhave 4m to 5m transistors.'\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3925': \"THE past year has seen big changes in the ownership of the companies which\\ndistribute computer equipment in the UK. In general, control of the leading\\ncompanies has moved outside of this country.\\nIn the past 12 months Frontline, one of the most successful of UK computer\\ndistributors, has been taken over by German distributor Computer 2000, while\\nnetwork specialist QDL has fallen to Micro Macro, a Netherlands combine, and\\nin the past few weeks Software Limited has been taken over by Ingram Micro\\nof the US.\\nThese changes of ownership are arguably less important than the changes in\\nthe structures of computer distribution channels that have been taking\\nplace.\\nA few years ago computer distribution channels in the UK could be defined\\nquite easily. The manufacturer at the top would sell equipment to\\ndistributors, who in their turn would sell it on to computer dealers. But\\nmore recently this three-tier structure has begun to erode.\\nPressure on profit margins has encouraged manufacturers to remove the centre\\ndistributor tier, and to deal direct with computer dealers, and even with\\ncustomers. At the same time, we have seen the growth of the super dealer,\\noperations such as Computacenter and Technology which are large enough to\\ndeal directly with suppliers, and dealer/distributors.\\nThe two types of operation meet in the middle, with dealer-led companies\\nsuch as Computacenter and Technology becoming, to all intents and purposes,\\ndistributors, and with distribution operations such as Rossendale, adding\\ncomputer dealer operations to broaden their base. Pressure on margins is\\nsuch that it is difficult to see, in the minds of many analysts, how an\\noperation that deals solely as an intermediary, taking equipment from a\\nmanufacturer and passing it on to a computer dealer without gaining any\\nextra profit margin from selling direct to users, can survive.\\nOne danger for the trade-only distributor is that the market will split,\\nleaving such companies handling mainly the more esoteric product ranges and\\nlower volume shipments to smaller dealers.\\nAs the bigger dealerships are beginning to show, and as smaller distributors\\nwhich move back into direct sales confirms, large amounts of money can be\\nmade through a combination of relatively limited product ranges shipped at\\nhigh volumes.\\nMr Derek Lewis, head of Technology, argues that large corporate dealerships\\nsuch as his own company should concentrate on on two, maybe three ranges of\\ncomputer hardware. Mr Lewis's company is a member of Comec, one of two big\\nEuropean dealer associations, and the implications of this are clear - if\\nthe dealers throughout Europe who are members of Comec decide on an official\\nrange of computers, they can drive a very hard bargain, forcing the margins\\nof manufacturers down.\\nThis worries Mr Don Pinchbeck, managing director at Epson UK. He feels that\\n'the reseller who is pan-European can seize power from manufacturers'. Comec\\nand the International Computer Group (ICG), which is the rival association\\nof which Computacenter is a member, can through the combined buying power of\\ntheir membership overturn the food chain, controlling the manufacturers\\nrather than being controlled. If this happens, Mr Pinchbeck sees computer\\nmanufacturers becoming very much like the suppliers of UK supermarkets,\\nhaving prices, terms and conditions dictated to them by a few all-powerful\\nchains. A possible escape-route, he feels, involves manufacturers learning\\nfrom the motor industry and moving machines tailored to individual\\nspecification straight off the production line. The manufacturer, in effect,\\nwould become a systems integrator.\\nOther manufacturers are however exploring different routes to survival. One\\nof the basic planks on which Compaq was founded was its determination not to\\nsell direct, but in recent years, as the power of its equipment has\\nincreased, the company has found itself evolving what is in effect a direct\\nsales force that does not sell direct.\\nWith the exception of the large chains, a company's individual dealers do\\nnot have the resources to sell adequately into what is, in effect, the\\nminicomputer market. If a company will not set up the kind of direct sales\\nforce traditionally used to sell minis, it finds itself forced to do an\\nincreasing amount of hand holding for the dealers who are making the sales.\\nCompaq UK has in the past few years hired a number of staff from mini\\nmanufacturers, and Mr Gian Carlo Bisone, head of European marketing, is no\\nstranger to these techniques.\\nThe nature of the market accentuates these problems. Mr Bisone describes the\\nprimary characteristic of the dealer channel as being that it has no money,\\nand Compaq pursues intricate schemes in order to inject money into it\\nwithout the extra cash disappearing in the shape of increased discounts to\\ncustomers.\\nTraining and joint marketing programmes are examples of how this can be\\ndone. Other manufacturers are engaged in heavy support programmes for their\\ndealer base, and one possible consequence of such approaches is that dealers\\n -particularly those who are not part of large associations - will become\\nmore closely bound to single manufacturers. These manufacturers may, albeit\\naccidentally, convert their dealer base into what is effectively a direct\\nsales force.\\nIn the UK, Apple has traditionally taken a similar approach to Compaq,\\nattempting to keep prices and the level of its dealer expertise high, and\\ntaking a highly combative line with discount houses. However, it has created\\na problem for itself, in terms of sales channels, with its new low-cost\\nrange of machines. There are rumours that the company will later this year\\nrelease a range aimed fair and square at the home/games market which\\nindicates that the problem can only get worse.\\nSelling these without overturning the applecart and forcing down prices on\\nits higher specification machines is a puzzle Apple is still working on. Mr\\nJohn Sculley, chief executive officer, has made confusing and perhaps\\nominous references to rapid turnover-style outlets.\\nThere is an alternative that Apple will almost certainly reject. If\\nmanufacturers in general find themselves facing lower margins on the\\nmachines they sell into distribution channels, is it not logical for them to\\nconsider reducing the number of tiers in the channels, or perhaps eliminate\\nthem completely by selling direct to users?\\nSpeaking at a conference in Dusseldorf last month, Mr Billy Ho, Mitac\\nassociate vice-president told the company's distributors that, at least for\\nmachines that are priced at commodity level, the company would have to face\\nup to a reduction in the number of tiers in the channels.\\nMitac, a Taiwanese company, is one of the largest computer manufacturers in\\nthe world, although its name isn't that well known to users because it has\\ntraditionally built for other computer companies. His view was that Mitac\\ndistributors worldwide would have to begin to sell direct to users in order\\nto increase sales and maintain profitability, and if as seems likely other\\nmanufacturers are thinking along similar lines, the future could hold\\nincreased terrors for independent dealers.\\nJohn Lettice,\\nEditor, MicroScope\",\n",

At one time, indeed, it seemed as if a genuine enthusiasm for\\ncommon standards might result in lower costs and greater simplicity of\\noperations for customers, a notion much promoted by the manufacturers\\nthemselves.\\nThe belief was that if manufacturers were prepared to agree common\\ntechnologies for operating computers, connecting them together and running\\nsoftware, users would be saved the cost and complexity of connecting\\ndissimilar hardware. At the same time, software suppliers would be able to\\nwrite programs capable of being run on any machine, cutting the cost of the\\nmultiple versions they have to produce at present.\\nThat, however, has proved a vain hope. For most computer users, the\\nstandards issue has become hopelessly confused. The suppliers have done\\nlittle to help matters, taking part in seemingly endless series of industry\\nconsortia to promote one standard or another. There are compelling financial\\nreasons for this apparent waywardness - backing the wrong standards horse\\ncan be an expensive mistake. But somewhere along the line, the idea of\\ncommon standards to which everybody in the industry adheres for the benefit\\nof the customer has been lost.\\nCommon standards are crucial to the idea of open systems, which most\\nobservers believe will play an increasingly important part in data\\nprocessing over the next decade.\\nWhat is an open system? According a new handbook*, they are defined as:\\n'those that conform to internationally agreed standards defining computing\\nenvironments that allow users to develop, run and interconnect applications\\nand the hardware they run on, from whatever source, without significant\\nconversion cost'.\\nThe author goes on to point out that the key factors for users are that no\\nsingle supplier actually 'owns' (that is, has control of) the environments\\ninvolved and that the mixing and matching of applications and hardware can\\nbe achieved without significant cost.\\nThe reality is that every supplier of any size is scrabbling to own, or at\\nleast share ownership, of any hardware or software element which looks as if\\nit stands a fair chance of becoming a standard. The result has been a series\\nof pitched battles which show no real signs of abating.\\nEven the oldest standards war, the fight over how best to connect computers\\ntogether in telecommunications networks, has yet to be resolved after more\\nthan 15 years.\\nOn the one hand, standards setting bodies are trying to establish a set of\\nrules called Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) which they have now almost\\ncompletely defined. On the other hand, International Business Machines (IBM)\\nis insisting that its SNA rules will remain the way for its own machines to\\nbe connected together, while many customers are content with rules called\\nTCP/IP devised by the US Defense Department.\\nOr consider, for example, the latest industry initiative, a consortium of 20\\nleading suppliers including the US companies Compaq, the leading supplier of\\nhigh performance personal computers, Control Data, the mainframe supplier\\nand Digital Equipment, the world's principal minicomputer maker. It also\\nincludes the Japanese suppliers NEC, Nippon Kokan KK and Sony.\\nThe consortium has established what it calls an Advanced Computing\\nEnvironment (Ace) whose elements include support for software operating\\nenvironments from Microsoft (OS/2 version 3.0) and the Santa Cruz Operation\\n(Open Desktop, a version of the Unix operating systems) and microprocessor\\nchips from Intel (80/386, 80/486 and so on) and MIPS Computer Systems'\\n(advanced reduced instruction set computing, or Risc) chips.\\nThe aim of the group is to 'unify' the industry by establishing standards\\ncombining software and hardware technologies from personal computers,\\ncomputer workstations and multi-processor computers.\\nThe group does not include, however, IBM, the world's largest computer\\nmanufacturer, which frequently seems to behave as if it feels it has an\\ninalienable right to decide which standards the industry will adopt. It is a\\nleading light behind the Open Software Foundation, which has been developing\\nits own Unix-like operating systems, OSF1.\\nSome observers see the formation of the Ace consortium as a challenge to\\nIBM; others as an attempt to displace Sun Microsystems from its dominant\\nposition in the Unix workstation market place.\\nSun, an ambitious, fast-growing company, has about two-thirds of the market\\nfor Unix workstations based on its proprietary Risc design called 'sparc'.\\nIt has been licensing this design widely in an aggressive attempt to\\nestablish it as the industry Risc standard.\\nOne of the first licensees was Solbourne, a workstation manufacturer. Mr\\nBarrie Murray-Upton, its vice-president of European operations, said after\\nthe announcement of Ace: 'Why would 20 of the world's leading computer\\nmanufacturers band together to form a consortium unless they were seriously\\nworried about the continuing success of sparc technology?'\\nThe Ace group's attempt to appear cohesive was not helped, either, by the\\nemergence of a splinter group among the 20 declaring its support for yet\\nanother version of Unix. The upshot of all this wrangling is that customers'\\nneed for genuinely open systems has been hijacked and treated with contempt\\nby rival industry gangs.\\nGroups of users have attempted to establish their own ginger groups, but\\nwith only limited success - General Motors' attempt to set a manufacturing\\nautomation protocol (MAP) is one example.\\nEarlier this year, in initiative sponsored by the user arm of X/Open, one of\\nthe earliest standards pressure groups,representing hundreds of users met in\\nDallas, Texas, to formulate plans to encourage manufacturers to speed up the\\nintroduction of open systems.

Today, the same customers - meteorologists, oil exploration\\norganisations, aerospace companies and automobile manufacturers - still need\\nsupercomputer performance.\\nPeugeot SA, for example, an organisation comprising the two French\\nautomobile manufacturers Automobiles Peugeot and Automobiles Citroen, has\\njust ordered a Cray YMP2E, a two processor system that nevertheless delivers\\nsome 600 mips. It will be used for general automobile research and design\\nincluding structural analysis, crash simulation, acoustic design and the\\nsimulation of car behaviour.\\nThe supercomputer landscape has changed irrevocably, however, over the past\\ntwo years. Control Data, the US supercomputing pioneer has moved out of the\\narea altogether, as commercial difficulties in other parts of its business\\nmade the heavy research and development investment necessary to stay at the\\nleading edge too great a burden.\\nSeymour Cray detached himself from Cray Research to establish a new company\\ndevoted to the development of the Cray 3, an innovative machine based on\\nchips fabricated in gallium arsenide, a material which makes possible speeds\\nof about three times the maximum possible from silicon.\\nThe new machine depends on a whole range of new technologies including\\nassembly by robots and is proving a severe challenge even for a man\\nrecognised as the world's foremost supercomputer designer.\\nInternational Business Machines, which for many years had tended to ignore\\nsupercomputing as a niche market where the return hardly justified the\\ninvestment, changed its mind and came back to the market with a family of\\nvector processors - conventional high performance mainframes with a bolt-on\\naccessory giving a performance for certain applications close to that of a\\nsupercomputer. It also funded research into an advanced supercomputer being\\ndeveloped by Mr Steve Chen, formerly a senior designer with Cray Research.\\nThe three Japanese mainframe manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC\\nlaunched supercomputers of impressive performance. While critics argue that\\ntheir machines are let down by inferior software when compared to the Cray\\nrange, there can be little doubt that in hardware terms the Japanese\\nmachines are set to challenge the best US designs\\nThe principal change in the market, however, has been wrought by a different\\nkind of advance. The emergence of two new kinds of supercomputer -\\nminisupercomputers and massively parallel machines, which offer much of the\\nperformance of a conventional supercomputer at a fraction of the cost - have\\nopened new markets for supercomputing. Supercomputers, in fact, is a name\\nnot much to the liking of computer engineers who prefer the expression\\n'scientific computers'.\\nOn this basis, a high performance Sun workstation carrying out scientific\\nand engineering calculations is in the foothills of supercomputer\\nperformance. Speed is the important factor especially where, for example,\\nweather forecasting is involved. As Mr Bryan Little, director of operations\\nfor Cray Research in Europe, points out, the calculations involved in\\nweather prediction can be carried out by a small machine - but by the time\\nthe answer has been delivered, the storm will have passed.\\nMinisupercomputers have the capacity to tackle many kinds of calculation and\\nsimulation. Some approach the speed of a full scale supercomputer. FPS\\nComputing, for example, which started out building 'go-faster' processors\\nhas launched a machine which it rates at 2.1bn flops on typical mathematical\\nroutines - close to the performance of a Dollars 20m Cray for less than\\nDollars 2m.\\nThe kinds of customer who can take advantage of minisupercomputing power\\ninclude scientists carrying out electromagnetic analysis, structural\\nanalysis, signal processing and computational chemistry.\\nTypical of the new superminicomputer manufacturers is Convex Computer\\nCorporation, another company experimenting with esoteric gallium arsenide\\ntechnology to give speed at low cost.\\nCray, faced with the first threat to its pre-eminence in supercomputing in\\nmany years, has been forced to meet the challenge from Convex and other\\nminisupercomputer makers by launching smaller, air-cooled models in its YMP\\nseries. It also bought a US-based minisupercomputer maker, Supertek\\nComputers, and now sells its S-1 machine.\\nMassively parallel machines are constructed by manufacturers such as\\nThinking Machines of the US.

Its turnover was\\nPounds 63m with pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.25m.\\nMr Sam Wauchope, managing director of Acorn Computers, said sales had been\\nuneven through the year.\\nHe did not think there would be a first-quarter sales increase and overall\\nhe believed total spending in schools would decline.\\nSchool computer sales normally surge in the first quarter of the year\\nbecause, with the end of the financial year in sight, special grants for\\ncomputer purchase, worth perhaps Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m, become available on\\nan ad hoc basis from the Department of Education and Science and the\\nDepartment of Trade and Industry.\\nIn the current economic climate, however, suppliers are not optimistic that\\nmoney will be available from these sources this year.\\nSchools and local education authorities have traditionally raced to spend\\ntheir financial allocations by the end of the financial year with the result\\nthat money from a variety of budgets becomes available for computers.\\nThis year, suppliers believe that schools are storing cash away against a\\nbleak economic outlook. The evidence is that they are deferring decisions to\\nbuy more computers.\\nWhile exact numbers have yet to be collated following the end of the\\ngovernment's financial year this month, it seems likely that a market that\\nwas expected to grow by 10 per cent will contract by the same amount, an\\noverall decline of some 20 per cent.\\nThis bad news comes at the end of 12 months of unsettling volatility in what\\nis normally a predictable market.\\nThe spread of local management of schools (LMS), which by 1993 will ensure\\nthat all schools in England and Wales with more than 200 pupils will control\\ntheir own budgets, has resulted in confusion and uncertainty among those\\nnewly responsible for, but unused to, taking decisions about computer\\nhardware and software. In the past, they have relied heavily on advice from\\nlocal education authority advisers. Some will continue to do so.\\nAlso, difficulties local authorities are experiencing in administering the\\npoll tax has added an element of uncertainty to the value of capitation\\ngrants they will make to schools.\\nSchool computing is not big business - the whole UK educational computer\\nmarket including colleges, polytechnics and universities is worth less than\\nPounds 200m.\\nIt is, however, a niche market par excellence in the computing business and\\nthose companies which have made it their own have enjoyed steady returns in\\nrecent years.\\nThe principal players, Acorn and Research Machines, derive their strength\\nfrom the intimate relationship they have built up with their customers,\\ntheir understanding of the educational process and their willingness to\\nprovide extensive service for modest returns.\\nLarge suppliers like IBM and Apple, while strong in the universities and\\ncolleges, have little part in school computing and are unlikely to make\\ninroads.\\nSchool computing is two markets in one - the market for educational\\ncomputing and the market for educational administration. Research Machines\\nand Acorn, with a wealth of ready-written, high quality educational software\\nhave cornered the market for educational computing in schools. They are less\\ndominant in educational administration where there is more of a need for\\nconventional computer power.\\nAcorn, part of the Italian Olivetti group which developed the BBC\\nmicrocomputer, has dominated the schools market since the early 1980s.\\nAcorn systems are installed in 85 per cent of schools. It is especially\\nstrong in the primary sector where it boasts familiarity and an impressive\\nrange of educational software, with more than 1,000 programs listed in the\\nAcorn Education Directory.\\nCompany's latest machines feature a high-performance microprocessor of its\\nown design which has persuaded Apple Computer of the US to establish a joint\\ncompany with VLSI Technology and Acorn to exploit the technology.\\nAbout half Acorn's revenues of about Pounds 50m come from sales to schools.\\nResearch Machines of Oxford, privately held, is second overall to Acorn, but\\nholds 44 per cent of the market in secondary schools and 29 per cent in\\ncolleges.\\nAbout 60 per cent of its sales of Pounds 63m are to schools and it has a\\nstrong toehold in government computing and computer-aided design.\\nResearch Machines competes in both the computers for education and computers\\nfor administration sectors. Recently it won a Pounds 4m order to provide\\nevery secondary school in Northern Ireland with the hardware and software\\nfor LMS.\\nWhile the combined effects of LMS, the economy and the poll tax on computer\\nsales are depressing for the companies involved, they also raise questions\\nabout the preparedness of schools to teach the national curriculum.\\nA recent study by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology - the\\nindependent body that reports to parliament on the scientific and\\ntechnological implications of big issues such as food irradiation and the\\ngreenhouse effect - suggested that schools in England and Wales would need\\nPounds 310m during the next five years to deliver the computer education\\nrequired by the curriculum.\\nIt is worrying that that sum is unlikely to be made available. It is equally\\nworrying that nobody seems sure of how much money schools will be prepared\\nto spend on computers in the next few years.\",\n",

Those, such as Olivetti,\\nthat are still keeping their heads above red ink, are showing greatly\\nreduced profitability. The crisis knows no national boundaries.\\nGermany: Siemens-Nixdorf chief executive Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig warned last\\nmonth that Europe's largest computer company, formed in 1990 from the ailing\\nNixdorf Computers and Siemens' computer interests, would not make profits\\nthis year as he had hoped, nor was he prepared to say when it would become\\nprofitable. The difficulties of assimilating Nixdorf, which had losses of\\nabout Dollars 636m in its last year as an independent company, have proved\\nfar greater than expected.\\nComparex, a joint venture between BASF and Siemens selling chiefly\\nmainframes built by Hitachi of Japan, on the other hand, made post-tax\\nprofits of DM42m, 31 per cent up on the previous year.\\nFrance: state-owned Bull's loss is thought to be a record for the industry\\nin any one year. It is made up of a FFr3bn operating loss and restructuring\\ncharges of about FFr3.8bn. The company is already well advanced with an\\nambitious programme of corporate changes designed to restore competitiveness\\nand vitality. It includes cutting the number of manufacturing plants from 13\\nto five, reducing staff by some 5,000 over the year and rationalising\\nresearch and development and marketing.\\nItaly: Olivetti has remained consistently in the black, but its\\nprofitability has been falling. Its 1990 turnover is not expected to show\\nmuch advance on the L9.031bn recorded in 1989 and its profits are expected\\nmuch below the L202.8bn announced that year. It is in the process of\\ntrimming 7,000 jobs from the workforce; manufacturing activities are being\\nrationalised both in Italy and the rest of the world as are direct and\\nindirect distribution networks.\\nThe Netherlands: Philips is shedding some 50,000 staff worldwide; the\\nresulting restructuring charges forced a loss of Fl 4.2bn last year; the\\nroot cause, however, was heavy losses in the information systems division.\\nNow Philips is moving away from computer systems of its own design to those\\nbuilt to industry standards.\\nThe UK: International Computers, Britain's largest information technology\\ncompany, while still generating good profits, was bought from STC by Fujitsu\\nlast year, leaving the telecommunications company free to concentrate on its\\ncore interests.\\nThe deal with Fujitsu came at the end of a series of abortive merger\\ndiscussions between ICL and several other European-owned computer companies.\\nApricot Computers, manufacturing arm of the Apricot Group was sold to\\nMitsubishi Electric of Japan last year.\\nIn a surprising reversal of fortune, both ICL and Apricot are now selling\\nUK-designed and manufactured computers in Japan. Smaller manufacturers have\\nbeen affected by the same malaise.\\nNorsk Data of Norway and Nokia Data of Finland are going through extensive\\nrestructuring and job losses in their attempts to return to profitability.\\nThe plight of Europe computer makers is, to some extent, a reflection of the\\ntroubles afflicting every large computer manufacturer worldwide.\\nCustomers, especially governments and the armed forces, are beginning to\\nmove rapidly from traditional, mainframe-based data processing systems to\\nso-called 'client server systems' where the computing power is supplied by\\nsmall computers and workstations networked together.\\nThere is growing demand for computers which can easily be connected into\\nclient server networks regardless of the manufacturer of origin. Industry\\nstandard or open systems are becoming preferred to proprietary designs.\\nThe shift in preference from proprietary designs to open systems took place\\nwith remarkable suddenness. It coincided with a rapid, but temporary,\\nsoftening in many of the European markets. Companies such as Nixdorf which\\nhad been gearing up on the back of powerful sales of their proprietary\\nsystems suddenly found themselves facing weak markets with systems which\\nwere no longer in fashion.\\nEurope will remain an important IT market though the US will remain\\ndominant. According to figures from the consultancy Price Waterhouse, the\\nworld IT market was worth Dollars 212bn in 1984; the US held 55 per cent,\\nEurope 25 per cent, Japan 10 per cent with a similar percentage for the rest\\nof the world.\\nBy 1992, according to Price Waterhouse, the overall value of the market will\\nhave grown to Dollars 649bn.\\nThe US share will have shrunk to 44 per cent, the European share will have\\ngrown to 31.5 per cent with Japan and the rest of the world holding 14 per\\ncent and 10.5 per cent respectively.\\nIt seems likely that US and Japanese manufacturers will profit from the\\ngrowth in the European market, however, rather than the local champions.\\nThere are sharply opposed views on what, if anything, should be done to\\nsupport European-owned companies. The French government which owns over 70\\nper cent of Groupe Bull has agreed to support its restructuring measures,\\nbut it understands that the company has to find a partner to share the load.\\nThere have been talks between Europe's main players aimed at establishing a\\nsingle transnational computer company able to rationalise research and\\ndevelopment costs and achieve continent-wide economies of scale, but they\\nhave all foundered on issue of management and control.\\nSome, looking at the example of Unisys of the US, question whether putting\\ntogether failing companies is anything more than a recipe for further\\nfailure.\\nThe European commission recently published a fiercely-debated plan to make\\nthe electronics industry more competitive based on training, standards,\\nbilateral agreements and collaborative research and development projects. No\\nnew money would be involved.\\nIn doing so, it has moved to more of a hands-off approach to encouraging\\ncompetitiveness than earlier and unsuccessful interventionist strategies.\\nThe fate of ICL within the Fujitsu organisation is being watched closely as\\nan example of the most extreme form of survival measure.

Many analysts believe the European and US figures will double within\\nthree years.\\nJapanese miniaturisation techniques are sure to help them lead the emerging\\npalmtop and tablet markets.

Hitachi and Fujitsu, in\\nparticular, have devoted significant resources to the development of\\nworld-class software.\\nSuch investments will pay off in the future, particularly as the world moves\\nin the direction of more open industry standards such as Unix, the operating\\nsystem developed by A T & T which seems destined to become a world standard\\nfor small computers.\\nIn the end, Japanese computer makers greatest strength may be the growing\\ndominance of other Japanese industrial sectors. As Japanese industries such\\nas automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and steel continue to expand and automate,\\nthey are sure to bring Japanese computer makers along with them.\\n'It's much tougher (for Japanese computer makers) to sell to GM than to\\nToyota or Nissan,' says Mr Steven Myers, an analyst at Jardine Fleming in\\nTokyo.

Most of the increase in sales will fall to Japanese makers. Japanese\\ncompanies will continue to prefer to grow internally. However, more\\ncompanies may resort to either taking equity positions or outright\\nacquisitions in fields in which Japanese companies trail, such as processing\\ntechnologies and software.\\n'The Japanese have to catch up in some areas and they know it,' says Mr\\nDargan. 'If they can't do it themselves, they'll engage in joint ventures or\\nacquisitions.' Joint ventures such as NMB-Intel are bound to increase as\\ncapital-starved US companies increasingly turn to their deep-pocketed\\nJapanese competitors.\\n'Small West Coast tech houses are vulnerable to being cherry-picked,' says\\nMr Dargan, pointing to TDK's Dollars 200m acquisition of Silicon Systems in\\n1989.\\nStill, Japan's dearth of software programmers - estimated at 600,000 - is\\nexpected to top 1m by the end of the century. Such a shortfall, argue most\\nanalysts, can only partially be made up by subcontracting work to Korea and\\nChina and by buying small US producers. But Japanese computer makers remain\\nundaunted. If anything, the only impediments most Japanese companies see in\\nthe way of their inevitable advance are political.\\nFujitsu, for one, has been extremely wary of a political backlash in Europe\\nfollowing its purchase of ICL and its exclusion from three of the five\\nEuropean research consortia to which ICL belonged. Consequently, Japanese\\nmakers will continue the less risky strategy of supplying European makers on\\nan OEM basis.\\n'Japanese manufacturers realise they just can't take market share through\\ncompetition alone,' says Mr Dargan. Japanese companies are diffusing\\nproprietary technologies in south-east Asia as the Newly Industrialized\\nEconomies (NIEs) repeat Japan's previous policy of insisting on technology\\ntransfer in return for access to their markets.\\nUS companies, burned by their liberal sharing of technology with Japanese\\ncompanies in the past, are trying to demand a more equitable sharing of\\nknow-how.\",\n",

But what can they get by\\nacquiring a company? Not much, except for distribution,' he adds.\\nJapanese companies prefer to stay away from high-profile acquisitions, even\\nfriendly ones such as ICL. Instead, most are concentrating on establishing\\ntheir own production and sales networks, preferably in the form of joint\\nventures.\\n'We have to be certain that investments in fields like semiconductors are\\nwelcome,' says Mr Taizo Nishimuro, general manager for overseas operations\\nat Toshiba. 'It might be easier to go it 100 per cent alone or to buy out an\\nexisting firm, but it doesn't guarantee us that those actions will be\\nwelcomed by the community.'\\nMost observers believe Toshiba will not be alone in co-operating with its\\nEuropean competitors. Olivetti may be forced to strengthen ties with various\\nJapanese companies, including Hitachi which provides it with hardware on an\\nOEM basis. Siemens sells Fujitsu mainframes and supercomputers, licenses\\nDrams from Toshiba, and given its distribution and service networks, is a\\nnatural match for a Japanese partner.\\nMeanwhile, Bull's increasing problems may force it to fully embrace NEC,\\nwhich now provides the French company with mainframes. 'Bull has to figure\\nout what it's going to cut, what it's going to keep, and what it's going to\\nsource out,' says Mr Steve Myers, analyst at Jardine Fleming (Securities) in\\nTokyo. 'It's entirely conceivable, but not certain, that Bull will become\\ndependent on NEC hardware and choose to add value through software,' he\\nsays.\\nSuch arrangements - Japanese hardware and customised local software - are\\nexpected to increase as more production becomes application specific.\\nFujitsu has formed joint ventures with Quotient of the UK and the British\\nsubsidiary of McDonnell Douglas, to develop software for the banking and\\nCAD/CAM industries respectively.\\nToshiba is developing CMOS chips with SGS Thomson Microelectronics of\\nHolland, while other Japanese producers are sourcing out much of their local\\nsoftware and design work. Moreover, even with higher capital costs and\\nmounting overcapacity in the memory chip market, Japanese companies have not\\nabandoned direct investment. NEC plans to begin construction of a new\\ncomputer production facility in Germany and has just completed upgrading its\\nplant in Scotland to produce four megabit Drams.\\nFujitsu will soon finish a new production facility in Durham in northern\\nEngland to produce similar chips.\\n'Investment has slowed,' admits Mr Mike Jeremy, an analyst at Baring\\nSecurities (Japan). 'But not as much as had been expected.'\\nMany analysts argue that one of the attractions of western Europe is its\\nposition as a springboard for eastern European market. Over 60 per cent of\\nJapanese products sold in eastern Europe are shipped from Japanese\\nsubsidiaries in the EC.\\n'Naturally, because of its proximity and its similar culture we do feel\\nentering eastern Europe is easier through the west, especially Germany,'\\nsays Mr Nishimuro. As personal incomes grow in the former Comecon states,\\nthe market will shift from large-scale infrastructure projects (a relative\\nEuropean strength) to consumer-driven purchases sure to favour the Japanese,\\nsay most analysts.\\nMoreover, some Japanese companies are attracted by the East's low wages and\\nrelatively well-educated workforce. Such allures may lead many Japanese\\ncompanies to shift much of their assembly operations to the east, and to\\nconcentrate on more value-added production in the West.\\n'To the extent you put semiconductor production into western Europe, board\\nstuffing can then be done where it's cheapest,' says Mr Myers.\\nPolitical uncertainties remain the greatest fear among senior executives in\\nTokyo. Fujitsu, in particular, is wary of projecting a high-profile image.\\n'ICL is a different company,' says Mr Yuri Momomoto, of Fujitsu. 'They have\\ntheir own plans which we don't know about.' Regardless, except for political\\nsensitivities, and perhaps being privy to the setting of standards, most\\nJapanese companies seem unconcerned with being shut out of European research\\nconsortia, largely because Japanese companies have much more to contribute\\nthan the Europeans themselves.\\n'It doesn't make sense to keep out the Japanese,' says Mr Jeremy. 'The\\nEuropeans will lose the opportunity to monitor them. It's a two-way street.\\nIt's no more Machiavellian than that.'\\nIn addition, many argue that dictates from Brussels may ultimately backfire.\\nA 1990 decision by the European Commission setting minimum prices for\\nJapanese chips allegedly being dumped in Europe may help Japanese producers\\nbeset by falling prices in the same way a similar 1985 US decree (now\\nexpired) rescued a Japanese chip industry drowning in its own overcapacity.\\nMoreover, adds Mr Benda, as Europe continues to insist that more products be\\nmanufactured locally, more Japanese companies will come, posing a further\\nthreat to European companies. Others argue, however, that even if Japanese\\ncompanies were to show that they are 'politically correct' by participating\\nin projects such as the research consortia, it is doubtful that they would\\nbe willing to share any of their most advanced technology - something they\\nhave never done in the past.\\n'There must be another mechanism by which the Japanese are forced to share\\nsome of their technology,' says a Tokyo-based industry observer. 'If the\\nEuropeans don't band together and try to do something then they may as well\\nthrow in the towel.'\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3933': \"THE US computer industry is in the midst of a broad restructuring driven by\\ntechnology advances that have changed the economics of computer\\nmanufacturing.\\nSome of the largest companies in the industry are being forced to make\\npainful adjustments, while a new generation of computer makers is growing\\nrapidly. Making these changes more difficult for all computer companies are\\nthe triple troubles of a recessionary domestic economy, European economic\\nills and the interruption of normal purchasing patterns created by the Gulf\\nWar.\\nThe effects of these problems are being keenly felt by many US computer\\ncompanies, creating an industry downturn in which revenue growth has been\\nstalled and earnings are expected to decline in the short term. While these\\neconomic problems are expected to be short lived, the fundamental changes\\nunder way in computer technology could reshape the industry in the 1990s,\\nanalysts predict.\\nThe most important technology trend is the rising power of the\\nmicroprocessor - the 'computer on a chip'. The initial impact of the\\nmicroprocessor was to create the personal computer, spawning a new\\ngeneration of computer companies in the 1980s such as Apple Computer, which\\nhas annual revenues of Dollars 5.5bn, and Compaq Computer with Dollars\\n3.6bn.\\nNetworking technology, which enables large numbers of PCs to be tied\\ntogether so that they can share data, transformed the PC from a stand-alone\\nsingle user machine into an important element of office automation systems.\\nThe PC has had a large impact upon the way computers are used in offices.\\nThey have greatly expanded the use of desktop computers and to a significant\\nextent displaced the minicomputer and computer terminals as standard office\\nautomation equipment. The computer workstation, also based upon\\nmicroprocessors, has had a similar impact upon the technical computing\\nfield.\\nEngineering workstations running computer-aided design programs, for\\nexample, have usurped the role of mid-range computers in thousands of\\nlaboratories and product development departments. Sun Microsystems, the\\nworkstation market leader, has established a Dollars 2.5bn market for\\nhigh-powered desktop computers based upon Reduced Instruction Set Computing\\n(RISC) microprocessors, largely at the expense of traditional computer\\ncompanies such as Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard.\\nHowever, the inroads of the microprocessor have just begun. High-powered\\ncomputer systems that rival the system performance of mainframes and\\nminicomputers are being built using multiple microprocessors. Companies such\\nas Sequent Computer can offer mainframe-class computers built around Intel\\nmicroprocessors at a fraction of the cost of IBM mainframes.\\nStratus Computer Systems is challenging IBM and Tandem Computers in the\\nmarket for fault tolerant computers for mission critical applications using\\ncomputers built around Motorola and MIPS Computers microprocessors. This\\nphenomenon, known as downsizing, has had an impact on the entire computer\\nindustry.\\n'The microprocessor has turned hardware computer economics upside down,'\\nsays Mr Steven Milunovich of Solomon Brothers, in a recent report on the\\ndiscontinuities in the computer industry. 'Multiprocessor systems will\\ndirectly threaten mainframe and minicomputer solutions,' he says.\\n'Relational data bases can transform data into information. Object-oriented\\nprogramming will reduce the applications backlogs that plague every level of\\ncomputing. And sophisticated networks will allow users to access data\\nseamlessly across the enterprise. Those vendors that can bridge these\\ndiscontinuities to aid customers in adopting new technologies, while\\nprotecting prior investments, will benefit the most,' he says. However,\\nhardware is only one side of the computer industry. Software and services\\nare growing faster and have higher profit margins.\\nCompanies such as Electronic Data Systems are riding the wave of the\\ncomputer services rise, providing computer users with solutions to their\\nincreasingly complex information technology needs.\\nAnother driving force behind the reshaping of the computer industry is the\\ntrend toward open-systems standards that enable different types and brands\\nof computers to work more efficiently together. With majority of computer\\ncompanies are pursuing open systems, with varying degrees of enthusiasm.\\nFor many, open systems represent an opportunity to infiltrate the customer\\nbases of industry leaders such as IBM and Digital Equipment, HP and Unisys.\\nThe industry leaders have adopted open systems in part as a defensive move.\\nThey view open systems as a means of providing customers with complete\\nsolutions to their computing needs.\\nOne of the critical needs of the 1990s among computer users, is to find a\\nway to tie together their inventories of computers, which have typically\\nbeen acquired in a rather haphazard fashion.\\nDuring the 1980s, distributed computing was in vogue. Departments of large\\ncorporations frequently installed their own computer networks or systems\\noften with little reference to the corporate data processing centre. Now,\\ncompanies are trying to tie these computers together to create\\nenterprise-wide networks.\\nEnthusiasm for open systems and the trend toward lower-cost computer power\\nleads some to conclude that the large US computer hardware companies are\\ndinosaurs. This is to ignore several factors. While the mainframe computer\\nis challenged by new technologies, it remains a dominant sector of the\\ncomputer industry providing, for example, about half of IBM's Dollars 69bn\\nannual revenues.\\nOpen systems, based upon the Unix operating system, are certainly becoming\\nmore popular, but they represent only 12 per cent of annual computer sales.\\nThe ability of established industry leaders to adjust to rapid changes in\\nthe computer industry is frequently brought into question, but IBM is\\nturning itself slowly but surely to address the issues of the computer\\nmarket head on.\\nIBM is focusing upon solution selling, reorganising its business units to\\nmore directly address the problems of its customers. Perhaps the best\\nmeasure of IBM's success comes from the large systems integrators, who\\nregard IBM as a direct competitor.\\nIBM has long been the market leader in the PC sector, which it quickly\\nrecognised as a big new market opportunity in the early 1980s. In the\\ncomputer workstation market, IBM has made a late, but remarkably successful\\nentry. Last year, the company sold Dollars 1bn-worth of its RS/60000\\nworkstations, leaping from nowhere to become the fifth largest workstation\\nsupplier. This year, IBM is expected to climb to number two or three in the\\nworkstation market and by 1993 will be neck and neck with Sun Microsystems,\\nthe market leader, according to industry analysts.\\nDigital Equipment is undergoing a painful metamorphosis. After suffering a\\nperiod of internal strife between supporters of open systems and\\ntraditionalists, Digital is putting together a coherent strategy. Digital\\nmaintains that open systems must incorporate proprietary software if the\\npromise of the open systems movement - inter-operability among dissimilar\\ncomputers - is to be fulfilled.\\nStandard proprietary systems which adhere to standards that allow\\ninter-operability, represent the way of the future, many in the industry\\nbelieve. Computers such as Digital's VAX would retain their distinct\\nfeatures, but acquire the ability to work with other types or brands of\\ncomputers. HP, the third largest US computer company, has overhauled its\\ncomputer product line to take advantage of microprocessor power and to\\nrespond to the open systems trend.\\nSimilarly, NCR and Data General have developed aggressive open systems\\nstrategies. Unisys, in spite of financial woes, is pursuing open systems. It\\nis too soon to count out the US computer industry leaders of the 1970s, but\\nit seems certain that they will be forced to concede a bigger share of the\\nmarket to the companies that emerged in the 1980s.\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                Leading worldwide computer companies\\n                     1984 vs 1989 (dollarbn)\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                Data proc.

       " 'FT911-3935': \"SINCE the early 1980s, when the desktop personal computer was still in its\\ninfancy, there have been numerous attempts to create 'portable' versions of\\nPCs. Only recently, however, have semiconductor, data storage and display\\ntechnology advanced to the point where a fully-functional PC can be packaged\\nin a compact, lightweight, carry-along unit.\\nThese technology advances are creating an increase in sales of laptop,\\nnotebook and pocket computers, with world-wide sales expected to top Dollars\\n8bn this year.\\nThe market for mobile computers has become one of the fastest growing\\nsectors of the computer business. The increase in mobile computer sales\\ncomes as sales of desktop personal computers are beginning to sag,\\nparticularly in the US.\\nBy the mid-1990s, portable computers will represent close to 50 per cent of\\nall types of PCs sold, market analysts predict. In Japan, laptop computers\\naccount for over 40 per cent of all PC sales. In Tokyo's crowded offices the\\nsmaller laptop computers are widely used on the desktop.\\nEurope is also caught up in the mobile computer revolution with unit sales\\nexpected to rise by over 30 per cent this year. Spurring much of this growth\\nis the new category of notebook computers - battery-powered machines that\\nare small enough to fit in a briefcase and weigh 8 lbs or less.\\nMore than 840,000 notebook computers were sold in the US in 1990, according\\nto International Data, a research company. It predicts that sales could rise\\nto 1.4m units in 1991 and rise to 6.2m by the middle of the decade.\\nThe US portable computer market has so far been dominated by Compaq Computer\\nand Tandy of the US, the Zenith DataSystems division of France's Groupe\\nBull, and Japanese makers Toshiba and NEC.\\nHowever, over the past year, as many as 40 computer companies have announced\\nnew portable computers.\\nMany have yet to deliver these products with delays blamed on shortages of\\ndisplays, disk-drives and microprocessors. Also entering the portable\\ncomputer fray are some of the largest US and European computer\\nmanufacturers.\\nInternational Business Machines recently unveiled its notebook computer in\\nits third attempt to find a place in the portable computer market. The IBM\\nPersonal System/2 L40 SX notebook computer is slightly larger and heavier\\nthan most products in this category, but it is designed to provide the full\\nfunctionality of the current generation of desktop computers, whereas many\\nnotebook computers compromise performance to achieve lower weight and price.\\nThe IBM notebook features a full-size keyboard virtually identical to that\\nfound on IBM's PS/2 desktop PCs; a standard memory of two megabytes and\\nmaximum memory of 18 MB; a 60 MB hard drive and a 10-inch Video Graphics\\nArray (VGA) display. All this comes in a 7.7 lb package priced in the US at\\nDollars 6,000.\\nThe recent entry of IBM into the notebook computer market, and the\\nanticipated announcement by Apple Computer this year of notebook-sized\\nversions of its Macintosh computers are expected to expand sales rather than\\nto unseat established suppliers.\\nDigital Equipment, Unisys, NCR and American Telephone & Telegraph are\\nexpected to launch mobile computer products this year. Portability still\\ncomes at a premium price, with most mobile computers up to 50 per cent more\\nthan equivalent desktop machines. Competition is spurring price cuts with\\nsome companies such as AST Research offering substantially lower prices on\\nnotebook computers.\\nTechnology advances are significantly expanding the capabilities of portable\\ncomputers.\\nFlat panel colour displays have recently been introduced by Toshiba and\\nother leading portable makers.\\nThe portable computer of the future will incorporate 'wireless\\ncommunications' according to many industry experts. Last month, NEC of Japan\\nintroduced one of the first portable computers with wireless communications.\\nThe 6.6 lb laptop computer incorporates a radio transceiver which enables it\\nto send and receive messages without a phone line.\\nNEC is offering the wireless computer only in Japan. Leading US computer\\nmakers also see radio communications becoming an important feature of\\nportable computers in the future.\\nApple recently filed a petition with the US Federal Communications\\nCommission (FCC) that, if approved, would let computers transmit and receive\\ninformation over radio waves instead of through a wired network.\\nFor today's users of portable computers, wireless communications represent a\\npotential solution to the difficulties of hooking portable computers up to\\ntelephones. While desktop personal computers that incorporate a model\\ngenerally have their own phone line, the portable computer must be plugged\\ninto a phone in whatever location the user finds himself.\\nYet to be resolved is one of the toughest technical challenges of building\\nportable computers - short battery life. Although power-management systems\\nand low-power components have significantly extended computer battery life,\\nbattery technology is advancing only slowly, computer makers complain.\\nA new category of PCs that is beginning to show promise is the hand-held or\\npocket computer. This market has been pioneered by Poqet Computer of\\nSunnyvale, California, whose 1.1 lb IBM-compatible PC fits easily into a\\ncoat pocket or handbag. The Poqet has been picked up by Infonet, the\\ninternational value-added network provider, as a portable communications\\nterminal, for sending and receiving electronic mail and other types of\\nmessages.\\nMr Stav Prodromou, founder and vice-chairman of Poqet, sees pocket-sized\\ncomputers creating new types of PC applications. These tiny computers are so\\nunobtrusive, he suggests, that they could be used to take notes during a\\nmeeting. Their light weight also makes them suitable for use as an\\nelectronic appointments calendar or time organiser.\\nAlso about to enter the hand-held computer market is Hewlett-Packard, which\\nthis month will introduce a calculator-sized unit with a built-in version of\\nthe popular Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.\\nOn the horizon is yet another new type of portable computers known as slate\\ncomputers. These notebook-sized devices will replace the familiar keyboard\\nwith an electronic pen. The user will simply write on the 'slate' or point\\nto icons to select functions.\\nNumerous applications are envisaged for these pen-based computers among\\npeople who do much of their work while standing or moving around. Doctors\\nand nurses might use them to update patients' notes or order tests, for\\nexample.\\nSoftware that enables the computer to interpret hand-written notes has been\\ndeveloped by Go Corporation, a California start-up. Microsoft, the leading\\nsupplier of PC software, is also developing handwriting recognition software\\nthat could be used as an extension of its existing PC operating systems.\\nGrid Systems, one of the pioneers of the portable computer market, offers a\\nslate computer with limited handwriting recognition capabilities. IBM and\\nApple Computer have both expressed great interest in the potential for this\\nnew technology. Market researchers at BIS Strategic Decisions predict that\\nsales of slate computers will top Dollars 1.5bn by 1995 and could become a\\nDollars 7bn market by the end of the decade.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3936': \"ON-LINE transaction processing has grown to encompass a full third of world\\ncomputer market since its beginnings in airline reservation systems and\\nbanking.\\nThese interactive computer systems serve in a growing range of business\\napplications, from production management to customer service. With sales\\nlast year of approximately Dollars 40bn worldwide, OLTP is growing at an\\nannual rate of about 20 per cent and will be a Dollars 72bn market by 1994,\\naccording to market analysts.\\nGrowth in the OLTP market is being driven by its broadening use in\\ntelecommunications, manufacturing and retail industries, which have become\\nbig users of OLTP. Technology advances in parallel processing and\\nmicroprocessor performance have downsized OLTP, creating applications and\\nmaking this mode of computing available to small and medium-sized businesses\\nas well as large corporations.\\nOLTP has been impacted by the trend toward open systems based upon the Unix\\noperating system. Unix-based OLTP will grow to between Dollars 18bn and\\nDollars 21bn by 1994, according to Dataquest, the market research company.\\nThe emergence of relational database management systems software has been a\\ndriving force in the growth of OLTP. These programs, which enable users to\\naccess information wherever it resides in a database, have become the basis\\nfor a broad range of business applications running on OLTP systems.\\n'Fault tolerant', or 'high availability' computers represent an important\\nsegment of the OLTP market. As businesses entrust their most critical\\nfunctions to computer systems, the reliability of the systems and their\\nability to continue functioning through power failures, component failures,\\nsoftware updates and all manner of events that can bring the average\\ncomputer to its knees has become vital.\\nTraditionally, OLTP systems have been based upon mainframe computers with\\nInternational Business Machines claiming the lion's share of the market. IBM\\nholds an estimated 55 per cent share of the OLTP market, largely based upon\\nits dominant role in mainframe computers. While IBM is expected to remain\\nthe market leader, its share of the OLTP market will decline, according to\\nindustry analysts, as microprocessor-based parallel processing systems -\\nmany of them running the Unix operating system - displace traditional\\nmainframes.\\nTandem Computers, pioneered the 'fault tolerant' computer market selling its\\nproprietary computers to banks and securities companies. Lower spending in\\nthe financial services industries have hurt Tandem's earnings over the past\\nyear but with 1990 revenues of Dollars 506.1bn the company remains the\\nmarket leader in fault-tolerant computers.\\nLast year, Tandem introduced its first open systems products, offering a\\nrange of Unix computers based upon Mips Computers Reduced Instruction Set\\nComputer (RISC) chips. In addition to selling its Unix computers direct to\\nend users, Tandem signed an agreement with A T & T under which the\\ntelecommunications and computing company will resell the Tandem products.\\nBiting at the heels of IBM and Tandem are a new generation of specialist\\nOLTP computer companies led by Stratus Computer, Sequent Computer Systems\\nand Pyramid Technology. Stratus specialises in what it terms 'critical\\non-line computing' or high availability computing for mission critical\\napplications.\\nStratus's stronghold is in the financial services industry where it provides\\nsystems for stock trading, automatic teller networks and credit card\\nauthorisation. Stratus is, however, expanding its customer base in other\\nfields such as retailing, manufacturing and telecommunications.\\nStratus recently launched a new product line based upon Intel's 860 Reduced\\nInstruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor, following a trend toward\\nthe use of high performance RISC processors in OLTP. The company is also\\nmaking a transition from a proprietary operating system to open systems\\nbased upon the Unix operating system.\\nSome 20 per cent of Stratus's Dollars 404m 1990 revenues came via IBM, which\\nsells Stratus computers on an OEM basis. Over the past year, however,\\nStratus's business with IBM has flattened as IBM increasingly targets\\n'mission critical' applications with its own computers.\\nStratus expects to expand its direct sales to more than compensate for the\\nIBM shortfall. The company is in particular targeting the emerging market\\nlligent networks' as deregulated telephone companies offer new services such\\nas store and forward facsimile, free-phone numbers and voice messaging\\nservices.\\nSequent Computer Systems' products, based upon the Intel line of\\nmicroprocessors running a version of the Unix operating system, demonstrate\\nthe price and performance advantages that microprocessor-based parallel\\nprocessing has over traditional mainframes.\\nSequent's Symmetry 2000 family of computers, introduced in January,\\nincorporates up to 30 of Intel's latest 486 microprocessors and achieves\\nmainframe class performance at what the company claims is an 80 per cent\\nprice/performance advantage over other Unix mainframe computers and an even\\ngreater edge over traditional proprietary mainframes.\\nThe 8-year-old Sequent, with 1990 revenues of Dollars 249m, has built its\\nbusiness upon automating applications that cannot be cost-effectively\\nhandled by a mainframe computer. Examples range from a currency management\\nsystem for British Airways to an emergency room scheduling system for a\\nCalifornia hospital.\\nPyramid Technology, another OLTP specialist, achieved a remarkable 73 per\\ncent growth in revenues in fiscal 1990, to reach Dollars 180m for the year\\nending last September. Pyramid, of the Silicon Valley, is about to launch a\\nrange of products based upon Mips Computer's RISC microprocessors.\\nWhile the niche players of the OLTP market are making inroads, the big\\ncompanies of the computer industry are not standing still. Unisys,\\ntraditionally a large supplier of mainframe-based OLTP and also a re-seller\\nof Sequent computers, last week unveiled hardware and software products that\\nestablish its strategic direction toward open-systems based OLTP.\\nUnisys expanded its product line with mid-range systems, which it will\\nmanufacture in-house. Based on the Intel 486 with up to five processors, the\\nnew Unisys 6000/65 has a peak performance of 118 MIPs and will run the\\nlatest version of A T & T's Unix, System V4.\\nUnisys also unveiled new Unix OLTP software including an improved version of\\nA T & T's 'transaction manager' which will improve performance and\\nreliability, the company claims.\\nDigital Equipment's OLTP revenues grew by approximately 35 per cent to\\nDollars 2.1bn in 1990, according to analysts at Hambrecht & Quist, the San\\nFrancisco investment bank.\\nDigital is emphasising fault tolerance. DEC launched its first specifically\\nfault-tolerant computers early last year but according to industry analysts\\nthe products failed to have a significant impact on the market.\\nLast month, DEC unveiled its second generation fault tolerant products - a\\nnew range of aggressively-priced VAX minicomputers designed for mission\\ncritical applications which analysts predict will do much better.\\nHewlett-Packard is also taking a stab at the fail-safe computer market\\nthrough an investment in Sequoia Systems, a small manufacturer of\\nfault-tolerant computers.\\nHP will resell Sequoia's machines and gain access to its technology. As\\ncompetition mounts, the OLTP market will become increasingly segmented,\\nanalysts predict. Increasingly, the ability to perform OLTP will become a\\nprerequisite of commercial computing systems or all sizes.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3937': \"THE WORLD'S large computer manufacturers have become used to rehearsing the\\nsuperficial reasons for the present crisis in the information technology\\nbusiness, a malaise which has brought many of the best-known names in data\\nprocessing to the brink of disaster.\\nThese include:\\nThe spread of open systems, computer networks based on standard industry\\ncomponents which cannot command the gross profit margins inherent in\\nproprietary designs. The gross margin built into a mainframe computer sale\\ncan be 70 per cent or more; for PCs and workstations, it can be less than 30\\nper cent.\\nA seemingly never-ending decline in the cost and growth in the power of data\\nprocessing equipment which has further squeezed manufacturer's margins. A\\nhigh performance workstation can cost less than Dollars 1,000 for every\\nmillion instructions per second (mips) of computer power. Mainframes\\ntypically cost more than Dollars 100,000 per mips. For many, but not all,\\ntasks it is possible to substitute low cost workstation power for mainframe\\npower.\\nThe growing importance of service suppliers and systems integrators who put\\ntogether hardware and software from disparate sources to satisfy their\\ncustomers' requirements. New competitors for the traditional industry as a\\nresult of this change include management consultancies such Anderson\\nConsulting and Price Waterhouse as well as software houses and value added\\nresellers.\\nA slackening in demand for computer systems which has been apparent in the\\nUS for some time and is becoming evident in Europe. The reasons are complex;\\nthey include saturation in some areas of the market, dissatisfaction with\\nthe results of continued computerisation and, in the UK at least, high\\ninterest rates.\\nThe effects of these changes have been shattering for many companies. In the\\nUS, Unisys, the result of a merger between Sperry and Burroughs only five\\nyears old, lost Dollars 436.7m in 1990 and suspended payment of dividends on\\nboth its common and preferred stock in an attempt to reduce debt which stood\\nat Dollars 3.7bn at the end of that year.\\nIn Europe, Groupe Bull, the French state-owned manufacturer announced a loss\\nof Pounds 700m for 1990 and said the French government had agreed to provide\\nPounds 400m in capital support to the company over 1991-92 in addition to\\nPounds 270m earmarked for research and development into Bull's open systems\\ndesigns.\\nUnisys and Bull are simply the most spectacular victims of the sickness\\naffecting the industry; almost every mainframe or minicomputer company in\\nthe US and Europe is demonstrating declining profitability if not actual\\nlosses.\\nEarnings per share at IBM, the world's largest computer company, for\\nexample, have been on a plateau for six years now. The company has spent\\nmore time and money than most over the past three years in attempting to\\nbring its expenses into line with sales, but earlier this month it shook the\\nstock market with a warning that its sales in the first quarter of 1991\\nwould be significantly weaker than expected; Wall Street analysts were\\ndowncast after the company's apparently strong recovery in 1990.\\nThe key to what is happening is the uneven nature of the picture. Suppliers\\nof PCs, workstations and high powered small systems have not been damaged to\\nanything like the same extent as mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers.\\nCompaq Computer, for example, the world leader in high powered PCs reported\\nsales in 1990 of Dollars 3.6bn, up 25 per cent from 1989, while net income\\nwas Dollars 455m, up from Dollars 333m the previous year. Its growth was\\nchiefly driven by international sales, up 54 per cent, while revenues grew\\nonly 5 per cent in the US.\\nApple Computer, a PC pioneer which has tended to go its own way in\\ntechnological development, had comparatively stagnant sales and earnings in\\n1990, but began a spectacular turnaround after the launch of new,\\naggressively priced computers featuring its proprietary 'Macintosh'\\ntechnology.\\nPyramid Technology of the US which makes high performance mid-range\\ncomputers using the 'Unix' operating system increased revenues by 93 per\\ncent last year and its pre-tax profits by 110 per cent. The Pyramid machines\\nare colloquially described as 'Unix hot boxes'; for prices between Pounds\\n34,000 and Pounds 500,000, they will outperform a mainframe. Other hot box\\nsuppliers include Arix and Sequent.\\nNew players are entering the industry, often from unexpected directions.\\nNippon Steel, for example, the world's largest steelmaking concern has\\ndeveloped notebook computers which it is marketing in the US and Europe as\\npart of a broad plan to diversify into computers and communications.\\nAll of this is evidence that the traditional computer business is being\\ndisplaced by a new industry, with which it has little in common, as surely\\nas the traditional Swiss watching making industry was brushed aside by\\nJapanese electronic timepiece manufacturers.\\nThis new computer industry has its origin not in traditional data processing\\nbut in the semiconductor industry and its expression in PCs and\\nworkstations.\\nThe traditional industry is characterised by proprietary computer designs\\nwhich lock customers into individual suppliers; prices are set to yield high\\ngross profit margins which are used to finance substantial direct sales\\nforces. These are the primary conduits between the manufacturer and the\\ncustomer. Applications software is developed chiefly by the customer's own\\nsoftware staff, perhaps with the help of a software house.\\nThe new industry is very different. Machine designs are similar between\\nsuppliers because they are based on widely available, industry standard\\nmicroprocessors. Most of the research and development work has been carried\\nout by the semiconductor manufacturer. Compaq, for example, spends about\\nhalf the industry average on research and development.\\nBecause margins are so narrow, direct sales forces are economically unviable\\nand sales take place principally through 'channels' - dealers, software\\nhouses, value added resellers and systems integrators. The key to success,\\nas in the case of Compaq, is a strong positive relationship with the\\nchannel.\\nOperating software is standard - usually a variation of the Unix system.\\nApplications software is packaged, developed by software specialists who\\nprefer to write programs which will run on a wide variety of machines rather\\nthan tie themselves to a single manufacturer.\\nThe question, therefore, is whether the members of the old industry are\\nsufficiently flexible to become new industry players, or whether they are\\ndoomed to extinction. Against this background, arguments about the value of\\nstate aid to national champions appear increasingly redundant.\\nAt present, most experts agree that only IBM is safe; it has the\\ndetermination, flexibility and, most important, the financial security to\\nchange course decisively.\\nThe future of the Japanese mainframe manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and\\nNEC, IBM's chief competitors is unclear. They continue to prosper in their\\nfast growing home market, but have yet to face the challenge of open systems\\nand networked computing which is causing their Western competitors so much\\nheartache.\\nSwiss watchmakers found salvation in fashion. An equivalent safe haven for\\nthe traditional computer industry is not yet in sight.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3938': \"Correction (published 25th April 1991) appended to this article.\\nTHE British computer industry is not what it once was.\\nInternational Computers Limited (ICL) is owned by Fujitsu, Apricot has sold\\nits computer hardware division to Mitsubishi, Sinclair Research is now part\\nof Mr Alan Sugar's Amstrad computer organisation and Acorn Computers has\\nlong been part of the large Olivetti empire.\\nThat does not mean that it is no longer a force to be reckoned with. Not\\nonly have some British computer companies, notably Amstrad, survived the\\nmarket consolidations of the 1980s, but leading international manufacturing\\nfacilities have come to the UK.\\nIn addition, smaller, home-grown companies with innovative hardware and\\nsoftware products, such as London-based Psion, have built their own\\nspecialist markets.\\nThis has taken place against a background of declining government investment\\nin high technology, the opening up of European markets in preparation for\\n1992 and the push for development of open computer systems.\\nICL, for example, has been behind a push in both the public and private\\nsector over the past few years to encourage the use and evolution of\\nstandard, open computer systems in the powerful mid-range and high-end mini\\nand mainframe sectors.\\nHowever, it seems that the open systems aren't always good news for UK\\ncomputer interests. According to Mr Tim Taylor, marketing director of\\nACT-Logsys, it is open systems which played a large part in inducing Apricot\\nto sell its hardware division to Mitsubishi.\\nACT-Logsys, a new company formed from a part of Apricot which was not sold\\noff, specialises in consultancy and support for large public and private\\nsector clients.\\n'One of the reasons we decided to find a partner for Apricot hardware was\\nthat with standardisation and globalisation, it was getting much harder for\\na UK supplier to survive on a worldwide scale,' says Mr Taylor.\\nThat search for a partner eventually led to Mitsubishi buying the company.\\nHe adds that the drive for standards has somewhat levelled the technology\\nplaying field and is forcing many of the smaller players to move into\\nspecialist markets to survive.\\nIronically, as computer companies founded by British nationals have either\\nbeen sold or folded, international companies, such as Compaq Computer and\\nConnor Peripherals have moved in to take their places.\\nCompaq, in particular, has seen a spectacular rise to success for its UK\\ncompany - headed by Mr Joe McNally, UK-born managing director. Mr McNally\\nsays that, in many ways, Compaq in the UK is just as much of a British\\ncompany as ICL had been.\\nCompaq has spent more than Dollars 76m on its Scottish manufacturing\\nfacility in the past three years. Compaq has built up an annual UK turnover\\nin excess of Dollars 1bn thanks largely to a combination of the revenues\\ngenerated by the factory and the company's sales in the UK.\\nIt was perhaps a sign of the times when Compaq found wholehearted and very\\nsenior UK government support for location of the factory in Scotland -\\nalthough other Compaq European subsidiaries were lobbying heavily to have it\\nelsewhere.\\nMr McNally recalls fondly one of the main elements in finally clinching the\\ndeal to build in Scotland.\\n'Former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher personally put pen to paper and\\nwrote to our US chairman Mr Rod Canion,' says Mr McNally.\\n'That played an important role in terms of him deciding to come here -\\nalthough we did have a lot of support from the government and the Locate in\\nScotland office,' adds Mr McNally.\\nHe suggests that investing as heavily as it has in the UK has produced a\\nlift in sales to public sector bodies, which have in the past largely turned\\nto Apricot for their personal computers.\\nHe says that public sector sales for Compaq in the rest of Europe account\\nfor only 8 per cent of its business. In the UK, that figure has recently\\nrisen to 18 per cent.\\n'Clearly the Scottish factory has been an influence,' he suggests. But while\\nCompaq is enjoying the benefits of increased public sector and corporate\\nsales, the recession has hit the lower end of the PC industry hard,\\nparticularly in the retail sector.\\nIBM-compatible PCs have become commodity consumer electronics products and\\nsuffer the same ups and downs as home fax systems, stereos and satellite\\ntelevision. Amstrad, British electronics company, for example, is feeling\\nthe bite of the recession.\\n'Business is not very good at the moment, but everyone is suffering,' admits\\nMr Alan Sugar, Amstrad founder and chairman. 'But that's no consolation.\\nIt's been bloody slow and probably will be for the next six or seven months\\n -even if interest rates drop 2 or 3 per cent. It was a bad January and\\nFebruary and the satellite business suffered in February. Things are\\nstarting to move again, but not in the volumes we had before Christmas,' he\\nsays.\\nMr Sugar, however, has bounced back many times before and is expected to\\nweather this recession well. At last month's CeBIT exhibition in Germany, he\\nbullishly announced three new products - designed to help lift his share of\\nthe portables and small desktop computer markets and to pioneer\\nparticipation in the colour laptop computing sector.\\nCorrection (published 25th April 1991).\\nIN TUESDAY'S computer industry survey, we suggested incorrectly that\\nSinclair Research was part of the Amstrad organisation. In 1986, Amstrad\\npurchased the right to use the Sinclair trade name together with Sinclair's\\nintellectual property rights, patents and stocks of home computers. Sir\\nClive Sinclair, however, retained ownership of Sinclair Research.\",\n",
       " 'FT911-3939': \"THE GULF war has dealt a sharp blow to the economy of Tunisia.\\nThe loss of foreign income from tourism and decline in domestic employment\\ncome at a time when industrial growth had been resuming after three years of\\ndrought, locust plagues and severe austerity.\\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has pushed through measures aimed at\\nliberalising the management of Tunisia's economy, while maintaining\\nausterity.\\nA budget deficit equivalent to 8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1986\\nwas turned into a surplus of 4 per cent last year but the Ministry of\\nPlanning forecasts no increase in the country's GDP this year.\\nThe government recognises that austerity is all the more necessary today and\\nhas gone ahead with plans to cut five days' pay from all salaried workers.\\nThe government expects exports of goods and services to suffer a shortfall\\nof TD850m (Dollars 895m), a figure which rises to more than TD1bn if the\\nloss of loans from Arab funds is included.\\nThis year could turn out to be the first since independence when the number\\nof job losses is greater than the number of new jobs. The Ministry of\\nPlanning estimates that 51,600 jobs will be lost and 48,000 created - this\\nat a time when 55,000 young Tunisians are entering the labour market every\\nyear.\\nThe social repercussions are grave. Ever more violent confrontations between\\nthe police and Islamic fundamentalist militants from the major opposition\\nparty, En Nahda (The Renaissance) has led to a climate in which the promises\\nof greater freedom of expression which accompanied President Ben Ali's\\nassumption of power have all but disappeared.\\nThe fallout from the war is expected to cost the balance of payments TD600m.\\nThe Tunisian government was quick to react and, three months ago, seized the\\nopportunity of a routine IMF review of the country's position to activate\\nthe enlarged facility it had arranged with the Fund in 1988, but never drawn\\ndown.\\nThe IMF is expected to agree to Tunisia drawing SDR138m (Dollars 190m) - a\\nsum equivalent to its quota with the Fund.\\nPreliminary government estimates give loss of export income and suggest\\nthree sectors will be badly affected:\\nTourism and transport where half of Tunis Air's fleet is grounded - TD470m.\\nThis figure is predicated on a 50 per cent decline in foreign visitors\\nduring the first six months of the year; Exports of goods - TD330m of which\\none third is accounted for by textiles;\\nTransfer payments - TD50m, the bulk of which are remittances from Tunisians\\nworking abroad.\\nTo these figures must be added the loss of TD200m worth of loans from\\nKuwaiti and Arab development funds which will lead to the delay of major\\nprojects.\\nA lower volume of imported capital goods and the decline in local spending\\nwill cut the import bill by TD350m, but this will still add TD600m to\\ninitial estimates of the balance of payments deficit.\\nThe domestic economic consequences of the Gulf war will thus be severe,\\ndespite the fact that an exceptionally plentiful rainfall should deliver a\\nvery good crop, thus reducing the need to import cereals. This would be all\\nthe more welcome as US aid has been cut by three-quarters.\\nThe US Congress appeared somehat disgruntled at Tunisia's refusal to join\\nthe coalition against Iraq. The benefits Morocco drew from sending troops to\\nthe Gulf stand in sharp contrast - Saudi Arabia gave King Hassan Dollars\\n700m last autumn.\\nAlthough most sectors of the economy have felt the repercussions of the Gulf\\nwar, tourism has been one of the immediate casualties. It accounts for\\none-fifth of foreign earnings and ensures the livelihood of 800,000 people.\\nTo a net loss of 13,500 jobs must be added the pressure on hotel owners to\\nshed labour if the number of foreign visitors does not pick up fast. In the\\ntransport sector, job losses will amount to 2,700.\\nThe construction industry is also likely to be affected since many new\\nhotels (Tunisia adds 5,000 beds every year) will not get the go-ahead.\\nThe manufacturing sector, where only a third of the 15,000 new jobs planned\\nfor 1991 will be created, could be further hit by an economic slowdown among\\nmajor client countries such as France.\\nThe Tunisian government has been quick to draw up a list of capital\\nexpenditure cuts and increase the price of certain items such as petrol.\\nIf tourism picks up faster than expected, the government will be spared the\\nworse. If public frustration grows, however, the risks of social and\\npolitical unrest will be only too clear.\",\n",

       " 'FT911-3947': \"assassinated head of the Treuhand agency charged with privatising East\\nGerman industry - resigned as state secretary of the German Economics\\nMinistry in 1980, he left to run a steel company.\\nAs announced last week, Sir Peter Middleton, who is resigning as permanent\\nsecretary of the UK Treasury next month, will move to the City as a director\\nand deputy chairman of the Barclays Bank group and to head Barclays'\\nnewly-formed markets and investment banking division.\\nOnce in the Square Mile, he will be rubbing shoulders with other ex-Treasury\\nknights. Sir Geoffrey Littler, one of Sir Peter's former deputies, was\\nappointed last week to be chairman of NatWest Investment Bank. Sir Douglas\\nWass, Sir Peter's immediate predecessor as permanent secretary, is\\nco-chairman of Nomura International.\\nThe amakudari, or 'descent from heaven', of these eminent gentlemen will\\ndoubtless gild their final working years. But what does it tell us about\\nBritain, and is it good news for the country?\\nJust as Downing Street was announcing Sir Peter's departure from the\\nTreasury, the Confederation of British Industry reported a sharp fall in\\nindustry's research and development since 1988.\\nThe report showed that industry-funded R&D in Britain, in proportion to\\noutput, was about half Japanese and German levels.\\nThe coincidence of these two news items gives powerful backing to an\\nargument put forward earlier this year by Mr Walter Eltis, the director\\ngeneral of the National Economic Development Office*, to the effect that\\nBritain's poor investment record in manufacturing and fragile international\\ncompetitiveness can be partly linked to too great a concentration of\\nnational effort in the areas of finance and banking.\\nMr Eltis cited figures showing that investment in financial services in\\nBritain rose 313 per cent in volume terms between 1979 and 1990 while\\ninvestment in manufacturing barely rose at all. In the 11 years, financial\\nsector investment as a share of total investment in plant and machinery rose\\nto 29.4 per cent from 11.7 per cent.\\nBut while the UK had put a 'great many eggs into the financial basket', the\\nrecent history of UK banking had exposed miscalculations and weaknesses such\\nas the catalogue of loss-making decisions at the Midland Bank.\\nMr Eltis concluded that excessive inflation, poor real rates of return and a\\npro-housing bias in the UK's financial institutions had also crimped\\ninvestment. But 'the impact on the direction of investment of an apparently\\nhyper-profitable City, the superiority of which now appears in part\\nillusory' was a factor.\\nWorryingly, Mr Eltis suggests that the recent woes in UK banking and\\ninsurance cast doubt over the ability of Britain's financial sector to reap\\nthe promised harvest of the Europrean single market. It will be up to Sir\\nPeter Middleton and the other mature madarins who make a bee-line for the\\nCity to prove him wrong.\\n****\\nA bias in favour of finance is not an exclusively British preserve. When Mr\\nJacques Attali, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and\\nDevelopment, sought a vehicle to turn his vision of a united European\\neconomic area stretching from the Urals to the coast of Portugal into\\nreality, he thought of a bank.\\nAt last week's inauguration of the EBRD in London, there were plenty of\\npeople suggesting that a better way of helping eastern and central Europe\\nmove to democracy and develop the market economy would be for the west to\\nlower trade barriers to products in which the former communist countries\\nhave a comparative advantage.\\nIn Washington last week, the Czechoslovak foreign minister Mr Jiri\\nDienstbier was giving the same message to President George Bush.\\nThe progress being made towards reaching association agreements between the\\nEuropean Community and Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia shows that the EC\\nis responding to these pressures. In London last week, Mr Henning\\nChristophersen, an EC Commission member, acknowledged that the former\\ncommunist states 'had no real economic prospects' without free access to the\\nindustrial world's markets.\\nThis view was echoed by Mr Attali, who said the EBRD would prepare a\\nstrategy for opening up trade relations between east and west. What this\\nwould entail was unclear, however. Like much else concerning the business\\noperations of the EBRD, it is a question of wait and see.\\n****\\nIs the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ripe for\\nexpansion? A South Korean delegation will visit the OECD this week for talks\\nabout joining the 24-nation Paris-based economic think tank of\\nindustrialised countries.\\nMexico is also a likely candidate, while several east European countries\\nhave also expressed an interest in joining.\\nNew members are only admitted to the club with the unanimous agreement of\\nexisting members. South Korea's human rights record could pose problems. But\\nit is a member of the EBRD which has the promotion of pluralism and\\ndemocracy among its goals.\\n*In 'The State of the Economy 1991', published by IEA, 2 Lord North Street,\\nLondon SW1P 3LB at Pounds 9.95.\",\n",
